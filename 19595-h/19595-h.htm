<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with the utmo&#383;t diffidence
that the following pages are &#383;ubmitted
to the in&#383;pection of the
Public: yet, however the limited abilities
of the author may have prevented
her from &#383;ucceeding to her wi&#383;h in the
execution of her pre&#383;ent attempt, &#383;he
humbly tru&#383;ts that the uprightne&#383;s of
her intention will procure it a candid
and favourable reception. The following
little E&#383;&#383;ays are chiefly calculated
for the younger part of her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[p 2]</a></span>
&#383;ex, who, &#383;he flatters her&#383;elf, will not
e&#383;teem them the le&#383;s, becau&#383;e they were
written immediately for their &#383;ervice.
She by no means pretends to have
compo&#383;ed a regular &#383;y&#383;tem of morals,
or a fini&#383;hed plan of conduct: &#383;he has
only endeavoured to make a few remarks
on &#383;uch circum&#383;tances as &#383;eemed
to her &#383;u&#383;ceptible of &#383;ome improvement,
and on &#383;uch &#383;ubjects as &#383;he imagined
were particularly intere&#383;ting to
young ladies, on their fir&#383;t introduction
into the world. She hopes they
will not be offended if &#383;he has occa&#383;ionally
pointed out certain qualities,
and &#383;ugge&#383;ted certain tempers, and
di&#383;po&#383;itions, as <i>peculiarly feminine</i>, and
hazarded &#383;ome ob&#383;ervations which naturally
aro&#383;e from the &#383;ubject, on the
different characters which mark the
&#383;exes. And here again &#383;he takes the
liberty to repeat that the&#383;e di&#383;tinctions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[p 3]</a></span>
cannot be too nicely maintained; for
be&#383;ides tho&#383;e important qualities common
to both, each &#383;ex has its re&#383;pective,
appropriated qualifications, which
would cea&#383;e to be meritorious, the in&#383;tant
they cea&#383;ed to be appropriated.
Nature, propriety, and cu&#383;tom have
pre&#383;cribed certain bounds to each;
bounds which the prudent and the
candid will never attempt to break
down; and indeed it would be highly
impolitic to annihilate di&#383;tinctions from
which each acquires excellence, and
to attempt innovations, by which both
would be lo&#383;ers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> therefore never under&#383;tand
their own intere&#383;ts &#383;o little, as when
they affect tho&#383;e qualities and accompli&#383;hments,
from the want of which
they derive their highe&#383;t merit. "The
<i>porcelain</i> clay of human kind," &#383;ays<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[p 4]</a></span>
an admired writer, &#383;peaking of the &#383;ex.
Greater delicacy evidently implies
greater fragility; and this weakne&#383;s, natural
and moral, clearly points out the
nece&#383;&#383;ity of a &#383;uperior degree of caution,
retirement, and re&#383;erve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the author may be allowed to
keep up the allu&#383;ion of the poet, ju&#383;t
quoted, &#383;he would a&#383;k if we do not
put the fine&#383;t va&#383;es, and the co&#383;tlie&#383;t
images in places of the greate&#383;t &#383;ecurity,
and mo&#383;t remote from any probability
of accident, or de&#383;truction?
By being &#383;o &#383;ituated, they find their
protection in their weakne&#383;s, and their
&#383;afety in their delicacy. This metaphor
is far from being u&#383;ed with a de&#383;ign
of placing young ladies in a trivial,
unimportant light; it is only
introduced to in&#383;inuate, that where
there is more beauty, and more weakne&#383;s,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[p 5]</a></span>
there &#383;hould be greater circum&#383;pection,
and &#383;uperior prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span>, on the contrary, are formed
for the more public exhibitions on the
great theatre of human life. Like the
&#383;tronger and more &#383;ub&#383;tantial wares,
they derive no injury, and lo&#383;e no
poli&#383;h by being always expo&#383;ed, and
engaged in the con&#383;tant commerce of
the world. It is their proper element,
where they re&#383;pire their natural air,
and exert their noble&#383;t powers, in
&#383;ituations which call them into action.
They were intended by Providence for
the bu&#383;tling &#383;cenes of life; to appear
terrible in arms, u&#383;eful in commerce,
&#383;hining in coun&#383;els.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author fears it will be hazarding
a very bold remark, in the opinion
of many ladies, when &#383;he adds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[p 6]</a></span>
that the female mind, in general, does
not appear capable of attaining &#383;o
high a degree of perfection in &#383;cience
as the male. Yet &#383;he hopes to be forgiven
when &#383;he ob&#383;erves al&#383;o, that as
it does not &#383;eem to derive the chief
portion of its excellence from extraordinary
abilities of this kind, it is
not at all le&#383;&#383;ened by the imputation of
not po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing them. It is readily allowed,
that the &#383;ex have lively imaginations,
and tho&#383;e exqui&#383;ite perceptions
of the beautiful and defective,
which come under the denomination of
Ta&#383;te. But preten&#383;ions to that &#383;trength
of intellect, which is requi&#383;ite to penetrate
into the ab&#383;tru&#383;er walks of literature,
it is pre&#383;umed they will readily
relinqui&#383;h. There are green pa&#383;tures,
and plea&#383;ant vallies, where they
may wander with &#383;afety to them&#383;elves,
and delight to others. They may cultivate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[p 7]</a></span>
the ro&#383;es of imagination, and the
valuable fruits of morals and critici&#383;m;
but the steep&#383; of Parna&#383;&#383;us few,
comparatively, have attempted to &#383;cale
with &#383;ucce&#383;s. And when it is con&#383;idered,
that many languages, and many
&#383;ciences, mu&#383;t contribute to the perfection
of poetical compo&#383;ition, it will
appear le&#383;s &#383;trange. The lofty Epic,
the pointed Satire, and the more daring
and &#383;ucce&#383;sful flights of the Tragic
Mu&#383;e, &#383;eem re&#383;erved for the bold adventurers
of the other &#383;ex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nor</span> does this a&#383;&#383;ertion, it is apprehended,
at all injure the intere&#383;ts of
the women; they have other preten&#383;ions,
on which to value them&#383;elves,
and other qualities much better calculated
to an&#383;wer their particular purpo&#383;es.
We are enamoured of the &#383;oft
&#383;trains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[p 8]</a></span>
Mu&#383;e, while, to the &#383;weet notes of the
pa&#383;toral reed, they &#383;ing the Contentions
of the Shepherds, the Ble&#383;&#383;ings of
Love, or the innocent Delights of rural
Life. Has it ever been a&#383;cribed to
them as a defect, that their Eclogues
do not treat of active &#383;cenes, of bu&#383;y
cities, and of wa&#383;ting war? No:
their &#383;implicity is their perfection, and
they are only blamed when they have
too little of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other hand, the lofty bards
who &#383;trung their bolder harps to higher
mea&#383;ures, and &#383;ung the <i>Wrath</i> of <i>Peleus'
Son</i>, and <i>Man's fir&#383;t Di&#383;obedience</i>,
have never been cen&#383;ured for want
of &#383;weetne&#383;s and refinement. The &#383;ublime,
the nervous, and the ma&#383;culine,
characteri&#383;e their compo&#383;itions; as the
beautiful, the &#383;oft, and the delicate,
mark tho&#383;e of the others. Grandeur,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[p 9]</a></span>
dignity, and force, di&#383;tingui&#383;h the one
&#383;pecies; ea&#383;e, &#383;implicity, and purity,
the other. Both &#383;hine from their native,
di&#383;tinct, unborrowed merits, not
from tho&#383;e which are foreign, adventitious,
and unnatural. Yet tho&#383;e excellencies,
which make up the e&#383;&#383;ential
and con&#383;tituent parts of poetry, they
have in common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> have generally quicker perceptions;
men have ju&#383;ter &#383;entiments.&mdash;Women
con&#383;ider how things may
be prettily &#383;aid; men how they may
be properly &#383;aid.&mdash;In women, (young
ones at lea&#383;t) &#383;peaking accompanies,
and &#383;ometimes precedes reflection; in
men, reflection is the antecedent.&mdash;Women
&#383;peak to &#383;hine or to plea&#383;e;
men, to convince or confute.&mdash;Women
admire what is brilliant; men
what is &#383;olid.&mdash;Women prefer an extemporaneous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[p 10]</a></span>
&#383;ally of wit, or a &#383;parkling
effu&#383;ion of fancy, before the mo&#383;t
accurate rea&#383;oning, or the mo&#383;t laborious
inve&#383;tigation of facts. In literary
compo&#383;ition, women are plea&#383;ed
with point, turn, and antithe&#383;is; men
with ob&#383;ervation, and a ju&#383;t deduction
of effects from their cau&#383;es.&mdash;Women
are fond of incident, men of
argument.&mdash;Women admire pa&#383;&#383;ionately,
men approve cautiou&#383;ly.&mdash;One &#383;ex
will think it betrays a want of feeling
to be moderate in their applau&#383;e,
the other will be afraid of expo&#383;ing a
want of judgment by being in raptures
with any thing.&mdash;Men refu&#383;e to
give way to the emotions they actually
feel, while women &#383;ometimes affect
to be tran&#383;ported beyond what
the occa&#383;ion will ju&#383;tify.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[p 11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a farther confirmation of what
has been advanced on the different
bent of the under&#383;tanding in the
&#383;exes, it may be ob&#383;erved, that we
have heard of many female wits, but
never of one female logician&mdash;of many
admirable writers of memoirs, but never
of one chronologer.&mdash;In the boundle&#383;s

a certain elevation in the narrative,
which places them, if not above what
is natural, yet above what is common.
It farther con&#383;i&#383;ts in the art of intere&#383;ting
the tender feelings by a pathetic
repre&#383;entation of tho&#383;e minute, endearing,

to in&#383;truct, or to in&#383;truct indirectly by
&#383;hort inferences, drawn from a long
concatenation of circum&#383;tances, is at

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> &#383;hort, it appears that the mind
in each &#383;ex has &#383;ome natural kind of
bias, which con&#383;titutes a di&#383;tinction of
character, and that the happine&#383;s of
both depends, in a great mea&#383;ure, on
the pre&#383;ervation and ob&#383;ervance of
this di&#383;tinction. For where would be
the &#383;uperior plea&#383;ure and &#383;ati&#383;faction
re&#383;ulting from mixed conver&#383;ation, if
this difference were aboli&#383;hed? If the

whereas con&#383;iderable advantages
are reaped from a &#383;elect &#383;ociety

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an argument in favour of modern
manners, it has been pleaded,
that the softer vices of Luxury
and Di&#383;&#383;ipation, belong rather to gentle
and yielding tempers, than to
such as are rugged and ferocious: that
they are vices which increa&#383;e civili<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[p 16]</a></span>zation,
and tend to promote refinement,
and the cultivation of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this is an a&#383;&#383;ertion, the truth
of which the experience of all ages
contradicts. Nero was not le&#383;s a tyrant
for being a fiddler: He<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who
wi&#383;hed the whole Roman people had
but one neck, that he might di&#383;patch
them at a blow, was him&#383;elf the mo&#383;t
debauched man in Rome; and Sydney
and Ru&#383;&#383;el were condemned to bleed
under the mo&#383;t barbarous, though mo&#383;t
di&#383;&#383;ipated and voluptuous, reign that
ever di&#383;graced the annals of Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love of di&#383;&#383;ipation is, I believe,
allowed to be the reigning evil of the
pre&#383;ent day. It is an evil which many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[p 17]</a></span>
content them&#383;elves with regretting,
without &#383;eeking to redre&#383;s. A di&#383;&#383;ipated
life is cen&#383;ured in the very act
of di&#383;&#383;ipation, and prodigality of time
is as gravely declaimed again&#383;t at the

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lover of dancing cen&#383;ures the
amu&#383;ements of the theatre for their

both for their levity. She, who&#383;e whole
&#383;oul is &#383;wallowed up in "<i>opera extacies</i>"
is a&#383;toni&#383;hed, that her acquaintance
can &#383;pend whole nights in preying,
like harpies, on the fortunes of
their fellow-creatures; while the grave
&#383;ober &#383;inner, who pa&#383;&#383;es her pale and
anxious vigils, in this fa&#383;hionable &#383;ort
of pillaging, is no le&#383;s &#383;urpri&#383;ed how

no ta&#383;te, in a language &#383;he does not
under&#383;tand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> &#383;hort, every one &#383;eems convinced,

are inwardly per&#383;uaded that it is not
with them&#383;elves. All de&#383;ire a general
reformation, but few will li&#383;ten to propo&#383;als
of particular amendment; the
body mu&#383;t be re&#383;tored, but each limb
begs to remain as it is; and accu&#383;ations
which concern all, will be likely to affect
none. They think that &#383;in, like
matter, is divi&#383;ible, and that what is
&#383;cattered among so many, cannot materially
affect any one; and thus individuals
contribute &#383;eparately to that

hinges on which the great machine
of human &#383;ociety turns. Tho&#383;e
who allow the influence which female
graces have, in contributing to poli&#383;h
the manners of men, would do well
to reflect how great an influence female
morals mu&#383;t al&#383;o have on their
conduct. How much then is it to be

ever &#383;it down contented to poli&#383;h, when

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a que&#383;tion frequently in the
mouths of illiterate and di&#383;&#383;ipated females&mdash;"What
good is there in reading?
To what end does it conduce?"
It is, however, too obvious to need in&#383;i&#383;ting
on, that unle&#383;s perverted, as
the be&#383;t things may be, reading an&#383;wers
many excellent purpo&#383;es be&#383;ide
the great leading one, and is perhaps
the &#383;afe&#383;t remedy for di&#383;&#383;ipation. She
who dedicates a portion of her lei&#383;ure
to u&#383;eful reading, feels her mind in a
con&#383;tant progre&#383;&#383;ive &#383;tate of improvement,
whil&#383;t the mind of a di&#383;&#383;ipated
woman is continually lo&#383;ing ground.
An active &#383;pirit rejoiceth, like the &#383;un,
to run his daily cour&#383;e, while indolence,
like the dial of Ahaz, goes
backwards. The advantages which
the under&#383;tanding receives from polite
literature, it is not here nece&#383;&#383;ary to
enumerate; its effects on the moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[p 23]</a></span>
temper is the pre&#383;ent object of con&#383;ideration.
The remark may perhaps be
thought too &#383;trong, but I believe it
is true, that next to religious influences,
an habit of &#383;tudy is the mo&#383;t
probable pre&#383;ervative of the virtue of
young per&#383;ons. Tho&#383;e who cultivate
letters have rarely a &#383;trong pa&#383;&#383;ion for
promi&#383;cuous vi&#383;iting, or di&#383;&#383;ipated &#383;ociety;
&#383;tudy therefore induces a reli&#383;h
for dome&#383;tic life, the mo&#383;t de&#383;irable
temper in the world for women. Study,
as it re&#383;cues the mind from an
inordinate fondne&#383;s for gaming, dre&#383;s,
and public amu&#383;ements, is an [oe]conomical
propen&#383;ity; for a lady may
read at much le&#383;s expence than &#383;he can
play at cards; as it requires &#383;ome application,
it gives the mind an habit
of indu&#383;try; as it is a relief again&#383;t
that mental di&#383;ea&#383;e, which the French
emphatically call <i>ennui</i>, it cannot fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[p 24]</a></span>
of being beneficial to the temper and
&#383;pirits, I mean in the moderate degree
in which ladies are &#383;uppo&#383;ed to u&#383;e it;
as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a
&#383;ocial virtue; as it demands the full
exertion of our talents, it grows a rational
duty; and when directed to the
knowledge of the Supreme Being, and
his laws, it ri&#383;es into an act of religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rage for reformation commonly
&#383;hews it&#383;elf in a violent zeal for &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing
what is wrong, rather than in
a prudent attention to e&#383;tabli&#383;h what is
right; but we &#383;hall never obtain a fair
garden merely by rooting up weeds,
we mu&#383;t al&#383;o plant flowers; for the
natural richne&#383;s of the &#383;oil we have
been clearing will not &#383;uffer it to lie
barren, but whether it &#383;hall be vainly
or beneficially prolific, depends on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[p 25]</a></span>
culture. What the pre&#383;ent age has
gained on one &#383;ide, by a more enlarged
and liberal way of thinking, &#383;eems to
be lo&#383;t on the other, by exce&#383;&#383;ive freedom
and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge
is not, as heretofore, confined
to the dull cloy&#383;ter, or the gloomy
college, but di&#383;&#383;eminated, to a certain
degree, among both &#383;exes and
almo&#383;t all ranks. The only mi&#383;fortune
is, that the&#383;e opportunities do
not &#383;eem to be &#383;o wi&#383;ely improved, or
turned to &#383;o good an account as might
be wi&#383;hed. Books of a pernicious,
idle, and frivolous &#383;ort, are too much
multiplied, and it is from the very
redundancy of them that true knowledge
is &#383;o &#383;carce, and the habit of
di&#383;&#383;ipation &#383;o much increa&#383;ed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been remarked, that the prevailing
character of the pre&#383;ent age is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[p 26]</a></span>
not that of gro&#383;s immorality: but if
this is meant of tho&#383;e in the higher
walks of life, it is ea&#383;y to di&#383;cern,
that there can be but little merit in
ab&#383;taining from crimes which there is
but little temptation to commit. It
is however to be feared, that a gradual
defection from piety, will in
time draw after it all the bad con&#383;equences
of more active vice; for whether
mounds and fences are &#383;uddenly
de&#383;troyed by a &#383;weeping torrent, or
worn away through gradual neglect,
the effect is equally de&#383;tructive. As
a rapid fever and a con&#383;uming hectic
are alike fatal to our natural health, &#383;o
are flagrant immorality and torpid indolence
to our moral well-being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> philo&#383;ophical doctrine of the
&#383;low rece&#383;&#383;ion of bodies from the &#383;un,
is a lively image of the reluctance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[p 27]</a></span>
which we fir&#383;t abandon the light of
virtue. The beginning of folly, and
the fir&#383;t entrance on a di&#383;&#383;ipated life
co&#383;t &#383;ome pangs to a well-di&#383;po&#383;ed
heart; but it is &#383;urpri&#383;ing to &#383;ee how
&#383;oon the progre&#383;s cea&#383;es to be impeded
by reflection, or &#383;lackened by remor&#383;e.
For it is in moral as in natural things,
the motion in minds as well as bodies
is accelerated by a nearer approach to
the centre to which they are tending.
If we recede &#383;lowly at fir&#383;t &#383;etting out,
we advance rapidly in our future
cour&#383;e; and to have begun to be
wrong, is already to have made a great
progre&#383;s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A constant</span> habit of amu&#383;ement
relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders
it totally incapable of application,
&#383;tudy, or virtue. Di&#383;&#383;ipation not only
indi&#383;po&#383;es its votaries to every thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[p 28]</a></span>
u&#383;eful and excellent, but di&#383;qualifies
them for the enjoyment of plea&#383;ure it&#383;elf.
It &#383;oftens the &#383;oul &#383;o much, that
the mo&#383;t &#383;uperficial employment becomes
a labour, and the &#383;lighte&#383;t inconvenience
an agony. The luxurious
Sybarite mu&#383;t have lo&#383;t all &#383;en&#383;e of
real enjoyment, and all reli&#383;h for true
gratification, before he complained
that he could not &#383;leep, becau&#383;e the
ro&#383;e leaves lay double under him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luxury</span> and di&#383;&#383;ipation, &#383;oft and
gentle as their approaches are, and
&#383;ilently as they throw their &#383;ilken

than the mo&#383;t active and turbulent vices.
The mightie&#383;t conquerors have been
conquered by the&#383;e unarmed foes: the
flowery &#383;etters are fa&#383;tened, before they
are felt. The blandi&#383;hments of Circe
were more fatal to the mariners of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[p 29]</a></span>
Uly&#383;&#383;es, than the &#383;trength of Polypheme,
or the brutality of the L&aelig;&#383;trigons.
Hercules, after he had
clean&#383;ed the Augean &#383;table, and performed
all the other labours enjoined
him by Euri&#383;theus, found him&#383;elf a
&#383;lave to the &#383;oftne&#383;&#383;es of the heart;
and he, who wore a club and a lion's
&#383;kin in the cau&#383;e of virtue, conde&#383;cended
to the mo&#383;t effeminate employments
to gratify a criminal weakne&#383;s.
Hannibal, who vanqui&#383;hed mighty
nations, was him&#383;elf overcome by the
love of plea&#383;ure; and he who de&#383;pi&#383;ed
cold, and want, and danger, and death

of him who plucks them; for they are
the only ro&#383;es which do not retain their
&#383;weetne&#383;s after they have lo&#383;t their
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heathen poets often pre&#383;&#383;ed on
their readers the nece&#383;&#383;ity of con&#383;idering
the &#383;hortne&#383;s of life, as an incentive
to plea&#383;ure and voluptuou&#383;ne&#383;s;
le&#383;t the &#383;ea&#383;on for indulging in them
&#383;hould pa&#383;s unimproved. The dark
and uncertain notions, not to &#383;ay the
ab&#383;olute di&#383;belief, which they entertained
of a future &#383;tate, is the only
apology that can be offered for this
rea&#383;oning. But while we cen&#383;ure their
tenets, let us not adopt their errors;
errors which would be infinitely more
inexcu&#383;able in us, who, from the
clearer views which revelation has
given us, &#383;hall not have their ignorance
or their doubts to plead. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[p 33]</a></span>
were well if we availed our&#383;elves of
that portion of their precept, which
inculcates the improvement of every
moment of our time, but not like them
to dedicate the moments &#383;o redeemed
to the pur&#383;uit of &#383;en&#383;ual and peri&#383;hable
plea&#383;ures, but to the &#383;ecuring of tho&#383;e
which are &#383;piritual in their nature, and
eternal in their duration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, indeed, like the mi&#383;erable<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> beings
imagined by Swift, with a view to
cure us of the irrational de&#383;ire after
immoderate length of days, we were
condemned to a wretched earthly immortality,
we &#383;hould have an excu&#383;e
for &#383;pending &#383;ome portion of our time
in di&#383;&#383;ipation, as we might then pretend,
with &#383;ome colour of rea&#383;on, that
we propo&#383;ed, at a di&#383;tant period, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[p 34]</a></span>
enter on a better cour&#383;e of action. Or
if we never formed any &#383;uch re&#383;olution,
it would make no material difference
to beings, who&#383;e &#383;tate was already unalterably
fixed. But of the &#383;canty
portion of days a&#383;&#383;igned to our lot, not
one &#383;hould be lo&#383;t in weak and irre&#383;olute
procra&#383;tination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have not yet determined
on the &#383;ide of vanity, who, like Hercules,
(before he knew the queen of
Lydia, and had learnt to &#383;pin) have
not re&#383;olved on their choice between
<span class="smcap">virtue</span> and <span class="smcap">pleasure</span>, may reflect,
that it is &#383;till in their power to imitate
that hero in his noble choice, and in
his virtuous rejection. They may al&#383;o
reflect with grateful triumph, that
Chri&#383;tianity furni&#383;hes them with a better
guide than the tutor of Alcides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[p 35]</a></span>
and with a &#383;urer light than the doctrines
of pagan philo&#383;ophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is far from my de&#383;ign &#383;everely to
condemn the innocent plea&#383;ures of life:
I would only beg leave to ob&#383;erve,
that tho&#383;e which are criminal &#383;hould
never be allowed; and that even the
mo&#383;t innocent will, by immoderate
u&#383;e, &#383;oon cea&#383;e to be &#383;o.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> women of this country were
not &#383;ent into the world to &#383;hun

were not de&#383;igned for wilds and &#383;olitudes,
but for the amiable and endearing
offices of &#383;ocial life. They have
u&#383;eful &#383;tations to fill, and important
characters to &#383;u&#383;tain. They are of a
religion which does not impo&#383;e penances,
but enjoins duties; a religion
of perfect purity, but of perfect bene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[p 36]</a></span>volence
al&#383;o. A religion which does
not condemn its followers to indolent
&#383;eclu&#383;ion from the world, but a&#383;&#383;igns
them the more dangerous, though
more honourable province, of living
uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion,
which does not direct them to fly from
the multitude, that they may do nothing,
but which po&#383;itively forbids
them to follow a multitude to do evil.</p>

<h2><br /><br />
THOUGHTS<br />
ON<br />
CONVERSATION.<br />
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been advi&#383;ed, and by very
re&#383;pectable authorities too, that in
conver&#383;ation women &#383;hould carefully
conceal any knowledge or learning
they may happen to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s. I own,
with &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ion, that I do not &#383;ee either
the nece&#383;&#383;ity or propriety of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[p 38]</a></span>
advice. For if a young lady has that
di&#383;cretion and mode&#383;ty, without which
all knowledge is little worth, &#383;he will
never make an o&#383;tentatious parade of
it, becau&#383;e &#383;he will rather be intent on
acquiring more, than on di&#383;playing
what &#383;he has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> at a lo&#383;s to know why a young
female is in&#383;tructed to exhibit, in the
mo&#383;t advantageous point of view, her
&#383;kill in mu&#383;ic, her &#383;inging, dancing,
ta&#383;te in dre&#383;s, and her acquaintance
with the mo&#383;t fa&#383;hionable games and
amu&#383;ements, while her piety is to be
anxiou&#383;ly concealed, and her knowledge
affectedly di&#383;avowed, le&#383;t the former
&#383;hould draw on her the appellation of
an enthu&#383;ia&#383;t, or the latter that of a
pedant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[p 39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> regard to knowledge, why &#383;hould
&#383;he for ever affect to be on her guard,
le&#383;t &#383;he &#383;hould be found guilty of a
&#383;mall portion of it? She need be the
le&#383;s &#383;olicitous about it, as it &#383;eldom
proves to be &#383;o very con&#383;iderable as to
excite a&#383;toni&#383;hment or admiration: for,
after all the acqui&#383;itions which her
talents and her &#383;tudies have enabled
her to make, &#383;he will, generally &#383;peaking,
be found to have le&#383;s of what is
called <i>learning</i>, than a common &#383;chool-boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be to the la&#383;t degree pre&#383;umptuous
and ab&#383;urd, for a young
woman to pretend to give the <i>ton</i> to the
company; to interrupt the plea&#383;ure of
others, and her own opportunity of
improvement, by talking when &#383;he
ought to li&#383;ten; or to introduce &#383;ubjects
out of the common road, in or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[p 40]</a></span>der
to &#383;hew her own wit, or expo&#383;e
the want of it in others: but were the
&#383;ex to be totally &#383;ilent when any topic
of literature happens to be di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed in
their pre&#383;ence, conver&#383;ation would lo&#383;e
much of its vivacity, and &#383;ociety would
be robbed of one of its mo&#383;t intere&#383;ting
charms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> ea&#383;ily and effectually may a
well-bred woman promote the mo&#383;t
u&#383;eful and elegant conver&#383;ation, almo&#383;t
without &#383;peaking a word! for the modes
of &#383;peech are &#383;carcely more variable than
the modes of &#383;ilence. The &#383;ilence of
li&#383;tle&#383;s ignorance, and the &#383;ilence of
&#383;parkling intelligence, are perhaps as
&#383;eparately marked, and as di&#383;tinctly
expre&#383;&#383;ed, as the &#383;ame feelings could
have been by the mo&#383;t unequivocal
language. A woman, in a company
where &#383;he has the lea&#383;t influence, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[p 41]</a></span>
promote any &#383;ubject by a profound
and invariable attention, which &#383;hews
that &#383;he is plea&#383;ed with it, and by an
illuminated countenance, which proves
&#383;he under&#383;tands it. Thi&#383; obliging attention
i&#383; the most flattering encouragement
in the world to men of &#383;en&#383;e and
letters, to continue any topic of in&#383;truction
or entertainment they happen
to be engaged in: it owed its introduction
perhaps to accident, the be&#383;t
introduction in the world for a &#383;ubject
of ingenuity, which, though it could
not have been formally propo&#383;ed without
pedantry, may be continued with
ea&#383;e and good humour; but which
will be frequently and effectually &#383;topped
by the li&#383;tle&#383;&#383;ne&#383;s, inattention, or
whi&#383;pering of &#383;illy girls, who&#383;e wearine&#383;s
betrays their ignorance, and who&#383;e
impatience expo&#383;es their ill-breeding.
A polite man, however deeply inte<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[p 42]</a></span>re&#383;ted
in the &#383;ubject on which he is
conver&#383;ing, catches at the &#383;lighte&#383;t hint
to have done: a look is a &#383;ufficient
intimation, and if a pretty &#383;impleton,
who &#383;its near him, &#383;eems <i>di&#383;traite</i>, he
puts an end to his remarks, to the
great regret of the rea&#383;onable part of
the company, who perhaps might have
gained more improvement by the continuance
of &#383;uch a conver&#383;ation, than
a week's reading would have yielded
them; for it is &#383;uch company as this,
that give an edge to each other's wit,
"as iron &#383;harpeneth iron."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> &#383;ilence is one of the great arts
of conver&#383;ation is allowed by Cicero
him&#383;elf, who &#383;ays, there is not only an
art but even an eloquence in it. And
this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
in the following little anecdote
from one of the ancients.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[p 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> many Grecian philo&#383;ophers
had a &#383;olemn meeting before the amba&#383;&#383;ador
of a foreign prince, each endeavoured
to &#383;hew his parts by the
brilliancy of his conver&#383;ation, that the
amba&#383;&#383;ador might have &#383;omething to
relate of the Grecian wi&#383;dom. One of
them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity
of his companions, ob&#383;erved a
profound &#383;ilence; when the amba&#383;&#383;ador,
turning to him, a&#383;ked, "But what
have you to &#383;ay, that I may report it?"
He made this laconic, but very pointed
reply: "Tell your king, that you have
found one among the Greeks who
knew how to be &#383;ilent."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a quality infinitely more
intoxicating to the female mind than
knowledge&mdash;this is Wit, the mo&#383;t captivating,
but the mo&#383;t dreaded of all
talents: the mo&#383;t dangerous to tho&#383;e<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[p 44]</a></span>
who have it, and the mo&#383;t feared by
tho&#383;e who have it not. Though it is
again&#383;t all the rules, yet I cannot find
in my heart to abu&#383;e this charming
quality. He who is grown rich without
it, in &#383;afe and &#383;ober dulne&#383;s, &#383;huns
it as a di&#383;ea&#383;e, and looks upon poverty
as its invariable concomitant. The
morali&#383;t declaims again&#383;t it as the
&#383;ource of irregularity, and the frugal
citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy
it&#383;elf, for he con&#383;iders it as the parent
of extravagance and beggary. The
Cynic will a&#383;k of what u&#383;e it is? Of
very little perhaps: no more is a
flower garden, and yet it is allowed as
an object of innocent amu&#383;ement and
delightful recreation. A woman, who
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;es this quality, has received a
mo&#383;t dangerous pre&#383;ent, perhaps not
le&#383;s &#383;o than beauty it&#383;elf: e&#383;pecially if
it be not &#383;heathed in a temper peculi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[p 45]</a></span>arly
inoffen&#383;ive, cha&#383;ti&#383;ed by a mo&#383;t
correct judgment, and re&#383;trained by
more prudence than falls to the common
lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> talent is more likely to make
a woman vain than knowledge; for as
Wit is the immediate property of its
po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or, and learning is only an acquaintance
with the knowledge of other
people, there is much more danger,
that we &#383;hould be vain of what is our
own, than of what we borrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Wit, like learning, is not near
&#383;o common a thing as is imagined.
Let not therefore a young lady be
alarmed at the acutene&#383;s of her own
wit, any more than at the abundance
of her own knowledge. The great
danger is, le&#383;t &#383;he &#383;hould mi&#383;take pertne&#383;s,
flippancy, or imprudence, for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[p 46]</a></span>
brilliant quality, or imagine &#383;he is
witty, only becau&#383;e &#383;he is indi&#383;creet.
This is very frequently the ca&#383;e, and
this makes the name of wit &#383;o cheap,
while its real exi&#383;tence is &#383;o rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lest</span> the flattery of her acquaintance,
or an over-weening opinion of
her own qualifications, &#383;hould lead
&#383;ome vain and petulant girl into a fal&#383;e
notion that &#383;he has a great deal of wit,
when &#383;he has only a redundancy of
animal &#383;pirits, &#383;he may not find it u&#383;ele&#383;s
to attend to the definition of this
quality, by one who had as large a
portion of it, as mo&#383;t individuals could
ever boa&#383;t:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a je&#383;t,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Neither can that have any place,<br /></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[p 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> tho&#383;e who actually po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s this
rare talent, cannot be too ab&#383;tinent in
the u&#383;e of it. It often makes admirers,
but it never makes friends; I mean,
where it is the predominant feature;
and the unprotected and defencele&#383;s
&#383;tate of womanhood calls for friend&#383;hip
more than for admiration. She
who does not de&#383;ire friends has a &#383;ordid
and in&#383;en&#383;ible &#383;oul; but &#383;he who
is ambitious of making every man her
admirer, has an invincible vanity and
a cold heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to dwell only on the &#383;ide of
policy, a prudent woman, who has
e&#383;tabli&#383;hed the reputation of &#383;ome ge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[p 48]</a></span>nius
will &#383;ufficiently maintain it, without
keeping her faculties always on
the &#383;tretch to &#383;ay <i>good things</i>. Nay,
if reputation alone be her object, &#383;he
will gain a more &#383;olid one by her forbearance,
as the wi&#383;er part of her acquaintance
will a&#383;cribe it to the right
motive, which is, not that &#383;he has le&#383;s
wit, but that &#383;he has more judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fatal fondne&#383;s for indulging a
&#383;pirit of ridicule, and the injurious and
irreparable con&#383;equences which &#383;ometimes
attend the <i>too prompt reply</i>, can
never be too &#383;eriou&#383;ly or too &#383;everely
condemned. Not to offend, is the fir&#383;t
&#383;tep towards plea&#383;ing. To give pain
is as much an offence again&#383;t humanity,
as again&#383;t good breeding; and
&#383;urely it is as well to ab&#383;tain from an
action becau&#383;e it is &#383;inful, as becau&#383;e
it is impolite. In company, young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[p 49]</a></span>
ladies would do well before they &#383;peak,
to reflect, if what they are going to
&#383;ay may not di&#383;tre&#383;s &#383;ome worthy per&#383;on
pre&#383;ent, by wounding them in
their per&#383;ons, families, connexions, or
religious opinions. If they find it
will touch them in either of the&#383;e, I
&#383;hould advi&#383;e them to &#383;u&#383;pect, that
what they were going to &#383;ay is not
&#383;o <i>very</i> good a thing as they at fir&#383;t
imagined. Nay, if even it was one of
tho&#383;e bright ideas, which <i>Venus has imbued
with a fifth part of her nectar</i>, &#383;o
much greater will be their merit in
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ing it, if there was a probability
it might offend. Indeed, if they
have the temper and prudence to make
&#383;uch a previous reflection, they will be
more richly rewarded by their own inward
triumph, at having &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed
a lively but &#383;evere remark, than they
could have been with the di&#383;&#383;embled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[p 50]</a></span>
applau&#383;es of the whole company, who,
with that complai&#383;ant deceit, which
good breeding too much authori&#383;es,
affect openly to admire what they &#383;ecretly
re&#383;olve never to forgive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> always been delighted with
the &#383;tory of the little girl's eloquence,
in one of the Children's Tales, who received
from a friendly fairy the gift,
that at every word &#383;he uttered, pinks,
ro&#383;es, diamonds, and pearls, &#383;hould
drop from her mouth. The hidden
moral appears to be this, that it was
the &#383;weetne&#383;s of her temper which produced
this pretty fanciful effect: for
when her malicious &#383;i&#383;ter de&#383;ired the
&#383;ame gift from the good-natured tiny
Intelligence, the venom of her own
heart converted it into poi&#383;onous and
loath&#383;ome reptiles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[p 51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of &#383;en&#383;e and breeding will
&#383;ometimes join in the laugh, which has
been rai&#383;ed at his expence by an ill-natured
repartee; but if it was very
cutting, and one of tho&#383;e &#383;hocking &#383;ort
of truths, which as they can &#383;carcely
be pardoned even in private, ought
never to be uttered in public, he does
not laugh becau&#383;e he is plea&#383;ed, but
becau&#383;e he wi&#383;hes to conceal how much
he is hurt. As the &#383;arca&#383;m was uttered

it, he will be the fir&#383;t to commend
it; but notwith&#383;tanding that, he will
remember it as a trait of malice, when
the whole company &#383;hall have forgotten
it as a &#383;troke of wit. Women are
&#383;o far from being privileged by their
&#383;ex to &#383;ay unhand&#383;ome or cruel things,
that it is this very circum&#383;tance which
renders them more intolerable. When
the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[p 52]</a></span>
no relief to him who is wounded to
reflect, that the hand which &#383;hot it
was a fair one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> women, when they have a
favourite point to gain, or an earne&#383;t
wi&#383;h to bring any one over to their opinion,
often u&#383;e a very di&#383;ingenuous
method: they will &#383;tate a ca&#383;e ambiguou&#383;ly,
and then avail them&#383;elves of
it, in whatever manner &#383;hall be&#383;t an&#383;wer

a &#383;tate of indeci&#383;ion as to their real
meaning, while they triumph in the
perplexity they have given you by the
unfair conclu&#383;ions they draw, from premi&#383;es
equivocally &#383;tated. They will
al&#383;o frequently argue from exceptions
in&#383;tead of rules, and are a&#383;toni&#383;hed

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a &#383;en&#383;ible company of both &#383;exes,

utmo&#383;t freedom of communication;
&#383;hould any one inquire what were the
general &#383;entiments on &#383;ome particular
&#383;ubject, it will, I believe, commonly
happen, that the ladies, who&#383;e imaginations
have kept pace with the narration,
have anticipated its end, and are
ready to deliver their &#383;entiments on it
as &#383;oon as it is fini&#383;hed. While &#383;ome
of the male hearers, who&#383;e minds were
bu&#383;ied in &#383;ettling the propriety, comparing
the circum&#383;tances, and examining
the con&#383;i&#383;tencies of what was &#383;aid,
are obliged to pau&#383;e and di&#383;criminate,

is &#383;o embarra&#383;&#383;ing as a variety of
matter, and the conver&#383;ation of women<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[p 54]</a></span>
is often more per&#383;picuous, becau&#383;e it
is le&#383;s laboured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of deep reflection, if he does
not keep up an intimate commerce
with the world, will be &#383;ometimes &#383;o
entangled in the intricacies of inten&#383;e

of a confu&#383;ed and perplexed expre&#383;&#383;ion;
while a &#383;prightly woman will
extricate her&#383;elf with that lively and
"ra&#383;h dexterity," which will almo&#383;t
always plea&#383;e, though it is very far
from being always right. It is ea&#383;ier
to confound than to convince an opponent;
the former may be effected by
a turn that has more happine&#383;s than
truth in it. Many an excellent rea&#383;oner,
well &#383;killed in the theory of the
&#383;chools, has felt him&#383;elf di&#383;comfited
by a reply, which, though as wide of
the mark, and as foreign to the que<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[p 55]</a></span>&#383;tion
as can be conceived, has di&#383;concerted
him more than the mo&#383;t &#383;tartling
propo&#383;ition, or the mo&#383;t accurate
chain of rea&#383;oning could have done;
and he has borne the laugh of his fair
antagoni&#383;t, as well as of the whole
company, though he could not but
feel, that his own argument was attended
with the fulle&#383;t demon&#383;tration:
&#383;o true is it, that it is not always nece&#383;&#383;ary
to be right, in order to be applauded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> let not a young lady's vanity
be too much elated with this fal&#383;e applau&#383;e,
which is given, not to her
merit, but to her &#383;ex: &#383;he has not perhaps
gained a victory, though &#383;he may
be allowed a triumph; and it &#383;hould
humble her to reflect, that the tribute
is paid, not to her &#383;trength but her
weakne&#383;s. It is worth while to di&#383;cri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[p 56]</a></span>minate
between that applau&#383;e, which
is given from the complai&#383;ance of
others, and that which is paid to our
own merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> great &#383;prightline&#383;s is the natural
bent of the temper, girls &#383;hould
endeavour to habituate them&#383;elves to

rea&#383;oning. I do not mean, that they
&#383;hould devote them&#383;elves to ab&#383;tru&#383;e
&#383;peculation, or the &#383;tudy of logic; but
&#383;he who is accu&#383;tomed to give a due
arrangement to her thoughts, to rea&#383;on
ju&#383;tly and pertinently on common
affairs, and judiciou&#383;ly to deduce effects
from their cau&#383;es, will be a better
logician than &#383;ome of tho&#383;e who claim
the name, becau&#383;e they have &#383;tudied
the art: this is being "learned without
the rules;" the be&#383;t definition,
perhaps, of that &#383;ort of literature which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[p 57]</a></span>
is propere&#383;t for the &#383;ex. That &#383;pecies
of knowledge, which appears to be the
re&#383;ult of reflection rather than of &#383;cience,
&#383;its peculiarly well on women.
It is not uncommon to find a lady,
who, though &#383;he does not know a rule
of Syntax, &#383;carcely ever violates one;
and who con&#383;tructs every &#383;entence &#383;he
utters, with more propriety than many
a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Ari&#383;totle by heart, and who can
lace his own thread-bare di&#383;cour&#383;e
with the golden &#383;hreds of Cicero and
Virgil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been objected, and I fear
with &#383;ome rea&#383;on, that female conver&#383;ation
is too frequently tinctured
with a cen&#383;orious &#383;pirit, and that ladies
are &#383;eldom apt to di&#383;cover much tenderne&#383;s

The worthy part of the
&#383;ex always expre&#383;s them&#383;elves humanely
on the failings of others, in proportion
to their own undeviating goodne&#383;s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> here I cannot help remarking,
that young women do not always carefully
di&#383;tingui&#383;h between running into
the error of detraction, and its oppo&#383;ite
extreme of indi&#383;criminate applau&#383;e.
This proceed&#383; from the fal&#383;e idea they
entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong mu&#383;t be right. Thus
the dread of being only &#383;u&#383;pected of
one fault makes them actually guilty
of another. The de&#383;ire of avoiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[p 59]</a></span>
the imputation of envy, impels them
to be in&#383;incere; and to e&#383;tabli&#383;h a
reputation for &#383;weetne&#383;s of temper and
genero&#383;ity, they affect &#383;ometimes to
&#383;peak of very indifferent characters
with the mo&#383;t extravagant applau&#383;e.
With &#383;uch, the hyperbole is a favourite
figure; and every degree of compari&#383;on
but the &#383;uperlative is rejected,
as cold and inexpre&#383;&#383;ive. But this
habit of exaggeration greatly weakens
their credit, and de&#383;troys the weight
of their opinion on other occa&#383;ions;
for people very &#383;oon di&#383;cover what degree
of faith is to be given both to
their judgment and veracity. And
tho&#383;e of real merit will no more be
flattered by that approbation, which
cannot di&#383;tingui&#383;h the value of what
it prai&#383;es, than the celebrated painter

&#383;uch and &#383;uch very capital but very

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been propo&#383;ed to the young,

&#383;ilence in regard to tho&#383;e, on which
they are known to excel.&mdash;But why
coun&#383;el this di&#383;ingenuous fraud? Why
add to the numberle&#383;s arts of deceit,
this practice of deceiving, as it were,
on a &#383;ettled principle? If to di&#383;avow

in&#383;inuate an idea of their &#383;kill, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[p 61]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> of all the qualifications for

affectation of introducing &#383;ubjects,
with which others are unacquainted,
and of di&#383;playing talents &#383;uperior to
the re&#383;t of the company, is as dangerous

with this vice. A &#383;pirit of emulation

every advancement in piety will

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an envious man is melancholy,
one may a&#383;k him, in the words
of Bion, what evil has befallen him&#383;elf,
or what good has happened to
another? This la&#383;t is the &#383;cale by
which he principally mea&#383;ures his felicity,
and the very &#383;miles of his friends
are &#383;o many deductions from his own
happine&#383;s. The wants of others are
the &#383;tandard by which he rates his own
wealth, and he e&#383;timates his riches,
not &#383;o much by his own po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions,

of their envy for &#383;ome trifling quality
or advantage, which it is &#383;carcely worth
while to po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s: they next proceed to
make a general profe&#383;&#383;ion of their own

the appearance of &#383;elf-po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, or
they could not &#383;o effectually injure.&mdash;The
angry man &#383;ets out by de&#383;troying
his whole credit with you at once,
for he very frankly confe&#383;&#383;es his abhorrence
and dete&#383;tation of the object of
his abu&#383;e; while the envious man carefully
&#383;uppre&#383;&#383;es all his own &#383;hare in

end of his re&#383;entment, by keeping <i>him&#383;elf</i>
continually before your eyes, in&#383;tead
of his enemy; while the envious
man artfully brings forward the object<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[p 69]</a></span>
of his malice, and keeps him&#383;elf out
of &#383;ight.&mdash;The angry man talks loudly
of his own wrongs; the envious of his
adver&#383;ary's inju&#383;tice.&mdash;A pa&#383;&#383;ionate per&#383;on,
if his re&#383;entments are not complicated

as the ira&#383;cible pa&#383;&#383;ions cannot con&#383;tantly
be at work, his heart may &#383;ometimes
get a holiday.&mdash;Anger is a violent
act, envy a con&#383;tant habit&mdash;no one can
be always angry, but he may be always
envious:&mdash;an angry man's enmity
(if he be generous) will &#383;ub&#383;ide when
the object of his re&#383;entment becomes
unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
it&#383;elf, if he finds his adver&#383;ary
bears it with dignity, or is pitied or
a&#383;&#383;i&#383;ted in it. The rage of the pa&#383;&#383;ionate
man is totally extingui&#383;hed by
the death of his enemy; but the ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[p 70]</a></span>tred
of the malicious is not buried even
in the grave of his rival: he will envy
the good name he has left behind him;
he will envy him the tears of his widow,

is le&#383;s malice, and le&#383;s mi&#383;chief too,

of it; as a worthier per&#383;on may
be involved in the mo&#383;t di&#383;graceful
&#383;u&#383;picions by &#383;uch a dangerous ambiguity.</p>

remove your &#383;u&#383;picions effectually, by
a&#383;&#383;uring you, that what they have ju&#383;t
related is only the popular opinion;
they them&#383;elves can never believe
things are &#383;o bad as they are &#383;aid to
be; for their part, it is a rule with
them always to hope the be&#383;t. It is
their way never to believe or report ill
of any one. They will, however,
mention the &#383;tory in all companies,
that they may do their friend the &#383;ervice
of prote&#383;ting their di&#383;belief of it.
More reputations are thus hinted away
by fal&#383;e friends, than are openly de&#383;troyed
by public enemies. An <i>if</i>, or
a <i>but</i>, or a mortified look, or a languid
defence, or an ambiguous &#383;hake
of the head, or a ha&#383;ty word affectedly

&#383;ucce&#383;s of its efforts depends on the

intends to &#383;trike a &#383;troke of Machiavelian

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many evils which

By the influence of time, and the perver&#383;ion

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> pre&#383;ent age may be termed, by
way of di&#383;tinction, the age of &#383;entiment,
a word which, in the implication
it now bears, was unknown to
our plain ance&#383;tors. Sentiment is the
varni&#383;h of virtue to conceal the deformity
of vice; and it is not uncommon
for the &#383;ame per&#383;ons to make a je&#383;t of
religion, to break through the mo&#383;t
&#383;olemn ties and engagements, to practi&#383;e
every art of latent fraud and open
&#383;eduction, and yet to value them&#383;elves
on &#383;peaking and writing <i>&#383;entimentally</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this refined jargon, which has
infe&#383;ted letters and tainted morals, is
chiefly admired and adopted by <i>young
ladies</i> of a certain turn, who read <i>&#383;en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[p 79]</a></span>timental

<p><span class="smcap">Error</span> is never likely to do &#383;o
much mi&#383;chief as when it di&#383;gui&#383;es its
real tendency, and puts on an engaging
and attractive appearance. Many
a young woman, who would be &#383;hocked
at the imputation of an intrigue,
is extremely flattered at the idea of a
&#383;entimental connexion, though perhaps
with a dangerous and de&#383;igning man,
who, by putting on this ma&#383;k of plau&#383;ibility
and virtue, di&#383;arms her of her
prudence, lays her apprehen&#383;ions a&#383;leep,
and involves her in mi&#383;ery; mi&#383;ery
the more inevitable becau&#383;e un&#383;u&#383;pected.
For &#383;he who apprehends no danger,
will not think it nece&#383;&#383;ary to be
always upon her guard; but will rather
invite than avoid the ruin which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[p 80]</a></span>
comes under &#383;o &#383;pecious and &#383;o fair a
form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity than an
avowed and authori&#383;ed attachment;
for one of the&#383;e &#383;entimental lovers will
not &#383;cruple very &#383;eriou&#383;ly to a&#383;&#383;ure a credulous
girl, that her unparalleled merit
entitles her to the adoration of the
whole world, and that the univer&#383;al
homage of mankind is nothing more
than the unavoidable tribute extorted
by her charms. No wonder then &#383;he
&#383;hould be ea&#383;ily prevailed on to believe,
that an individual is captivated
by perfections which might en&#383;lave a
million. But &#383;he &#383;hould remember,
that he who endeavours to intoxicate
her with adulation, intends one day
mo&#383;t effectually to humble her. For
an artful man has always a &#383;ecret de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[p 81]</a></span>&#383;ign
to pay him&#383;elf in future for every
pre&#383;ent &#383;acrifice. And this prodigality
of prai&#383;e, which he now appears to
lavi&#383;h with &#383;uch thoughtle&#383;s profu&#383;ion,
is, in fact, a &#383;um [oe]conomically laid
out to &#383;upply his future nece&#383;&#383;ities:
of this &#383;um he keeps an exact e&#383;timate,
and at &#383;ome di&#383;tant day promi&#383;es him&#383;elf
the mo&#383;t exorbitant intere&#383;t for it.
If he has addre&#383;s and conduct, and,
the object of his pur&#383;uit much vanity,
and &#383;ome &#383;en&#383;ibility, he &#383;eldom fails
of &#383;ucce&#383;s; for &#383;o powerful will be his
a&#383;cendancy over her mind, that &#383;he
will &#383;oon adopt his notions and opinions.
Indeed, it is more than probable
&#383;he po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ed mo&#383;t of them before, having
gradually acquired them in her
initiation into the &#383;entimental character.
To maintain that character with
dignity and propriety, it is nece&#383;&#383;ary
&#383;he &#383;hould entertain the mo&#383;t elevated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[p 82]</a></span>
ideas of di&#383;proportionate alliances, and
di&#383;intere&#383;ted love; and con&#383;ider fortune,
rank, and reputation, as mere
chimerical di&#383;tinctions and vulgar prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lover, deeply ver&#383;ed in all the
obliquities of fraud, and &#383;killed to wind
him&#383;elf into every avenue of the heart
which indi&#383;cretion has left unguarded,
&#383;oon di&#383;covers on which &#383;ide it is mo&#383;t
acce&#383;&#383;ible. He avails him&#383;elf of this
weakne&#383;s by addre&#383;&#383;ing her in a language
exactly con&#383;onant to her own
ideas. He attacks her with her own
weapons, and oppo&#383;es rhap&#383;ody to
&#383;entiment&mdash;He profe&#383;&#383;es &#383;o &#383;overeign
a contempt for the paltry concerns of
money, that &#383;he thinks it her duty to
reward him for &#383;o generous a renunciation.
Every plea he artfully advances
of his own unworthine&#383;s, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[p 83]</a></span>
con&#383;idered by her as a fre&#383;h demand
which her gratitude mu&#383;t an&#383;wer. And
&#383;he makes it a point of honour to &#383;acrifice
to him that fortune which he
is too noble to regard. The&#383;e profe&#383;&#383;ions
of humility are the common artifice
of the vain, and the&#383;e prote&#383;tations
of genero&#383;ity the refuge of the
rapacious. And among its many
&#383;mooth mi&#383;chiefs, it is one of the &#383;ure
and &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful frauds of &#383;entiment, to
affect the mo&#383;t frigid indifference to
tho&#383;e external and pecuniary advantages,
which it is its great and real
object to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A sentimental</span> girl very rarely
entertains any doubt of her per&#383;onal
beauty; for &#383;he has been daily accu&#383;tomed
to contemplate it her&#383;elf, and
to hear of it from others. She will
not, therefore, be very &#383;olicitous for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[p 84]</a></span>
the confirmation of a truth &#383;o &#383;elf-evident;
but &#383;he &#383;u&#383;pects, that her
preten&#383;ions to under&#383;tanding are more
likely to be di&#383;puted, and, for that
rea&#383;on, greedily devours every compliment
offered to tho&#383;e perfections,
which are le&#383;s obvious and more refined.
She is per&#383;uaded, that men
need only open their eyes to decide
on her beauty, while it will be the
mo&#383;t convincing proof of the ta&#383;te,
&#383;en&#383;e, and elegance of her admirer,
that he can di&#383;cern and flatter tho&#383;e
qualities in her. A man of the character
here &#383;uppo&#383;ed, will ea&#383;ily in&#383;inuate
him&#383;elf into her affections, by
means of this latent but leading foible,
which may be called the guiding clue
to a &#383;entimental heart. He will affect
to overlook that beauty which attracts
common eyes, and en&#383;nares common
hearts, while he will be&#383;tow the mo&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[p 85]</a></span>
delicate prai&#383;es on the beauties of her
mind, and fini&#383;h the climax of adulation,
by hinting that &#383;he is &#383;uperior
to it.</p>

&#383;uffered, like mere &#383;ublunary connexions,
to terminate in the vulgar cata&#383;trophe

which lately &#383;eemed to be looked on

pa&#383;&#383;ion, the &#383;igh of di&#383;&#383;embled
rapture, or the language of premeditated
adoration. No longer is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[p 87]</a></span>
altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations
of fictitious fondne&#383;s, the incen&#383;e
of fal&#383;ehood, or the &#383;acrifice of
flattery.&mdash;Her apotheo&#383;is is ended!&mdash;She
feels her&#383;elf degraded from the
dignities and privileges of a godde&#383;s,
to all the imperfections, vanities, and
weakne&#383;&#383;es of a &#383;lighted woman, and
a neglected wife. Her faults, which
were &#383;o lately overlooked, or mi&#383;taken
for virtues, are now, as Ca&#383;&#383;ius &#383;ays,
&#383;et in a note-book. The pa&#383;&#383;ion,
which was vowed eternal, la&#383;ted only
a few &#383;hort weeks; and the indifference,
which was &#383;o far from being
included in the bargain, that it was
not &#383;o much as &#383;u&#383;pected, follows them
through the whole tire&#383;ome journey of
their in&#383;ipid, vacant, joyle&#383;s exi&#383;tence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> much for the <i>completion</i> of the
&#383;entimental hi&#383;tory. If we trace it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[p 88]</a></span>
back to its beginning, we &#383;hall find
that a dam&#383;el of this ca&#383;t had her head
originally turned by pernicious reading,
and her in&#383;anity confirmed by
imprudent friend&#383;hips. She never fails
to &#383;elect a beloved <i>confidante</i> of her
own turn and humour, though, if &#383;he
can help it, not quite &#383;o hand&#383;ome as
her&#383;elf. A violent intimacy en&#383;ues, or,
to &#383;peak the language of &#383;entiment,
an intimate union of &#383;ouls immediately
takes place, which is wrought to the
highe&#383;t pitch by a &#383;ecret and voluminous
corre&#383;pondence, though they live
in the &#383;ame &#383;treet, or perhaps in the
&#383;ame hou&#383;e. This is the fuel which
principally feeds and &#383;upplies the dangerous
flame of &#383;entiment. In this
corre&#383;pondence the two friends encourage
each other in the fal&#383;e&#383;t notions
imaginable. They repre&#383;ent romantic
love as the great important bu&#383;ine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[p 89]</a></span>&#383;s
of human life, and de&#383;cribe all the
other concerns of it as too low and
paltry to merit the attention of &#383;uch
elevated beings, and fit only to employ
the daughters of the plodding
vulgar. In the&#383;e letters, family affairs
are mi&#383;repre&#383;ented, family &#383;ecrets divulged,
and family mi&#383;fortunes aggravated.
They are filled with vows
of eternal amity, and prote&#383;tations of
never-ending love. But interjections
and quotations are the principal embelli&#383;hments
of the&#383;e very &#383;ublime
epi&#383;tles. Every panegyric contained
in them is extravagant and hyperbolical,
and every cen&#383;ure exaggerated
and exce&#383;&#383;ive. In a favourite, every
frailty is heightened into a perfection,
and in a foe degraded into a crime.
The dramatic poets, e&#383;pecially the
mo&#383;t tender and romantic, are quoted
in almo&#383;t every line, and every pom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[p 90]</a></span>pous
or pathetic thought is forced to
give up its natural and obvious meaning,
and with all the violence of mi&#383;application,
is compelled to &#383;uit &#383;ome
circum&#383;tance of imaginary woe of the
fair tran&#383;criber. Alicia is not too mad
for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild
for her &#383;oft emotions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fathers</span> <i>have flinty hearts</i> is an expre&#383;&#383;ion
worth an empire, and is always
u&#383;ed with peculiar empha&#383;is and
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m. For a favourite topic of
the&#383;e epi&#383;tles is the groveling &#383;pirit
and &#383;ordid temper of the parents, who
will be &#383;ure to find no quarter at the
hands of their daughters, &#383;hould they
pre&#383;ume to be &#383;o unrea&#383;onable as to
direct their cour&#383;e of reading, interfere
in their choice of friends, or interrupt
their very important corre&#383;pondence.
But as the&#383;e young ladies are fertile in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[p 91]</a></span>
expedients, and as their genius is never
more agreeably exerci&#383;ed than in
finding re&#383;ources, they are not without
their &#383;ecret exultation, in ca&#383;e either
of the above intere&#383;ting events
&#383;hould happen, as they carry with
them a certain air of tyranny and per&#383;ecution
which is very delightful. For
a prohibited corre&#383;pondence is one of
the great incidents of a &#383;entimental life,
and a letter clande&#383;tinely received, the
&#383;upreme felicity of a &#383;entimental lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> can equal the a&#383;toni&#383;hment
of the&#383;e &#383;oaring &#383;pirits, when their
plain friends or prudent relations pre&#383;ume
to remon&#383;trate with them on any
impropriety in their conduct. But if
the&#383;e worthy people happen to be
&#383;omewhat advanced in life, their contempt
is then a little &#383;oftened by pity,
at the reflection that &#383;uch very anti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[p 92]</a></span>quated
poor creatures &#383;hould pretend
to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies
of their great refinement, &#383;en&#383;e, and
reading. They con&#383;ider them as wretches
utterly ignorant of the &#383;ublime plea&#383;ures
of a delicate and exalted pa&#383;&#383;ion;
as tyrants who&#383;e authority is to be contemned,
and as &#383;pies who&#383;e vigilance is
to be eluded. The prudence of the&#383;e
worthy friends they term &#383;u&#383;picion,
and their experience dotage. For they
are per&#383;uaded, that the face of things
has &#383;o totally changed &#383;ince their parents
were young, that though they
might then judge tolerably for them&#383;elves,
yet they are now (with all
their advantages of knowledge and
ob&#383;ervation) by no means qualified to
direct their more enlightened daughters;
who, if they have made a great
progre&#383;s in the &#383;entimental walk, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[p 93]</a></span>
no more be influenced by the advice
of their mother, than they would go
abroad in her laced pinner or her brocade

than by this over-confidence in
their own judgment, and this haughty
di&#383;dain of the opinion of tho&#383;e who
have known more days. Youth has
a quickne&#383;s of apprehen&#383;ion, which it
is very apt to mi&#383;take for an acutene&#383;s
of penetration. But youth, like cunning,
though very conceited, is very
&#383;hort-&#383;ighted, and never more &#383;o than
when it di&#383;regards the in&#383;tructions of
the wife, and the admonitions of the
aged. The &#383;ame vices and follies influenced
the human heart in their
day, which influence it now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[p 94]</a></span>
nearly in the &#383;ame manner. One who
well knew the world and its various
vanities, has &#383;aid, "The thing which
hath been, it is that which &#383;hall be,
and that which is done is that which
&#383;hall be done, and there is no new
thing under the &#383;un."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is al&#383;o a part of the &#383;entimental
character, to imagine that none but
the young and the beautiful have any
right to the plea&#383;ures of &#383;ociety, of
even to the common benefits and ble&#383;&#383;ings
of life. Ladies of this turn al&#383;o
affect the mo&#383;t lofty di&#383;regard for u&#383;eful
qualities and dome&#383;tic virtues;
and this is a natural con&#383;equence: for
as this &#383;ort of &#383;entiment is only a weed
of idlene&#383;s, &#383;he who is con&#383;tantly and
u&#383;efully employed, has neither lei&#383;ure
nor propen&#383;ity to cultivate it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[p 95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A sentimental</span> lady principally
values her&#383;elf on the enlargement of
her notions, and her liberal way of
thinking. This &#383;uperiority of &#383;oul
chiefly manife&#383;ts it&#383;elf in the contempt
of tho&#383;e minute delicacies and little decorums,
which, trifling as they may
be thought, tend at once to dignify
the character, and to re&#383;train the
levity of the younger part of the &#383;ex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the error here complained
of, originates in mi&#383;taking <i>&#383;entiment</i>
and <i>principle</i> for each other. Now I
conceive them to be extremely different.
Sentiment is the virtue of <i>ideas</i>,
and principle the virtue of <i>action</i>. Sentiment
has its &#383;eat in the head, principle
in the heart. Sentiment &#383;ugge&#383;ts
fine harangues and &#383;ubtile di&#383;tinctions;
principle conceives ju&#383;t notions, and
performs good actions in con&#383;equence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[p 96]</a></span>
of them. Sentiment refines away the
&#383;implicity of truth and the plainne&#383;s
of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has
remarked of his no le&#383;s celebrated
contemporary, gives us virtue in words
and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be
called the Athenian, who <i>knew</i> what
was right, and principle the Lacedemonian
who <i>practi&#383;ed</i> it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the&#383;e qualities will be better
exemplified by an attentive con&#383;ideration
of two admirably drawn characters
of Milton, which are beautifully,
delicately, and di&#383;tinctly marked.
The&#383;e are, Belial, who may not
improperly be called the <i>Demon of Sentiment</i>;
and Abdiel, who may be
termed the <i>Angel of Principle</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[p 97]</a></span></p>

oppo&#383;ed to principle, yet I am con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[p 101]</a></span>vinced,
that true genuine &#383;entiment,
(not the &#383;ort I have been de&#383;cribing)
may be &#383;o connected with principle,
as to be&#383;tow on it its brighte&#383;t lu&#383;tre,
and its mo&#383;t captivating graces. And
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m is &#383;o far from being di&#383;agreeable,
that a portion of it is perhaps
indi&#383;pen&#383;ably nece&#383;&#383;ary in an engaging
woman. But it mu&#383;t be the
enthu&#383;ia&#383;m of the heart, not of the &#383;en&#383;es.
It mu&#383;t be the enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which grows
up with a feeling mind, and is cheri&#383;hed
by a virtuous education; not that which
is compounded of irregular pa&#383;&#383;ions, and
artificially refined by books of unnatural
fiction and improbable adventure.
I will even go &#383;o far as to a&#383;&#383;ert,
that a young woman cannot have any
real greatne&#383;s of &#383;oul, or true elevation
of principle, if &#383;he has not a tincture
of what the vulgar would call Romance,
but which per&#383;ons of a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[p 102]</a></span>
way of thinking will di&#383;cern to proceed
from tho&#383;e fine feelings, and that
charming &#383;en&#383;ibility, without which,
though a woman may be worthy, yet
&#383;he can never be amiable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this dangerous merit cannot be
too rigidly watched, as it is very apt
to lead tho&#383;e who po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s it into inconveniencies
from which le&#383;s intere&#383;ting
characters are happily exempt. Young
women of &#383;trong &#383;en&#383;ibility may be
carried by the very amiablene&#383;s of this
temper into the mo&#383;t alarming extremes.
Their ta&#383;tes are pa&#383;&#383;ions. They
love and hate with all their hearts, and
&#383;carcely &#383;uffer them&#383;elves to feel a rea&#383;onable
preference before it &#383;trengthens
into a violent attachment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an innocent girl of this open,
tru&#383;ting, tender heart, happens to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[p 103]</a></span>
with one of her own &#383;ex and age,
who&#383;e addre&#383;s and manners are engaging,
&#383;he is in&#383;tantly &#383;eized with an ardent
de&#383;ire to commence a friend&#383;hip
with her. She feels the mo&#383;t lively
impatience at the re&#383;traints of company,
and the decorums of ceremony.
She longs to be alone with her, longs
to a&#383;&#383;ure her of the warmth of her tenderne&#383;s,
and generou&#383;ly a&#383;cribes to
the fair &#383;tranger all the good qualities
&#383;he feels in her own heart, or rather
all tho&#383;e which &#383;he has met with in her
reading, di&#383;per&#383;ed in a variety of heroines.
She is per&#383;uaded, that her new
friend unites them all in her&#383;elf, becau&#383;e
&#383;he carries in her prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ing
countenance the promi&#383;e of them all.
How cruel and how cen&#383;orious would
this inexperienced girl think her mother
was, who &#383;hould venture to hint,
that the agreeable unknown had de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[p 104]</a></span>fects
in her temper, or exceptions in
her character. She would mi&#383;take the&#383;e
hints of di&#383;cretion for the in&#383;inuations
of an uncharitable di&#383;po&#383;ition. At fir&#383;t
&#383;he would perhaps li&#383;ten to them with
a generous impatience, and afterwards
with a cold and &#383;ilent di&#383;dain. She
would de&#383;pi&#383;e them as the effect of
prejudice, mi&#383;repre&#383;entation, or ignorance.
The more aggravated the cen&#383;ure,
the more vehemently would &#383;he
prote&#383;t in &#383;ecret, that her friend&#383;hip
for this dear injured creature (who is
rai&#383;ed much higher in her e&#383;teem by
&#383;uch injurious &#383;u&#383;picions) &#383;hall know
no bounds, as &#383;he is a&#383;&#383;ured it can
know no end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> this tru&#383;ting confidence, this
hone&#383;t indi&#383;cretion, is, at this early period
of life as amiable as it is natural;
and will, if wi&#383;ely cultivated, produce,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[p 105]</a></span>
at its proper &#383;ea&#383;on, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded
circum&#383;pection of premature, and
therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I
believe, are &#383;eldom &#383;truck with the&#383;e
&#383;udden prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ions in favour of each
other. They are not &#383;o un&#383;u&#383;pecting,
nor &#383;o ea&#383;ily led away by the predominance
of fancy. They engage more
warily, and pa&#383;s through the &#383;everal
&#383;tages of acquaintance, intimacy, and
confidence, by &#383;lower gradations; but
women, if they are &#383;ometimes deceived
in the choice of a friend, enjoy even
then an higher degree of &#383;ati&#383;faction
than if they never tru&#383;ted. For to be
always clad in the burthen&#383;ome armour
of &#383;u&#383;picion is more painful and
inconvenient, than to run the hazard
of &#383;uffering now and then a tran&#383;ient
injury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[p 106]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the above ob&#383;ervations only
extend to the young and the inexperienced;
for I am very certain, that
women are capable of as faithful and
as durable friend&#383;hip as any of the
other &#383;ex. They can enter not only
into all the enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic tenderne&#383;s,
but into all the &#383;olid fidelity of attachment.
And if we cannot oppo&#383;e in&#383;tances
of equal weight with tho&#383;e of
Ny&#383;us and Euryalus, The&#383;eus and Pirithous,
Pylades and Ore&#383;tes, let it be
remembered, that it is becau&#383;e the recorders
of tho&#383;e characters were men,
and that the very exi&#383;tence of them is
merely poetical.</p>

a well-bred woman, and &#383;hould &#383;eem
to be the natural effects of a meek

outward and vi&#383;ible &#383;igns of it: for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[p 108]</a></span>
they are no more meekne&#383;s it&#383;elf, than

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> nothing is more common than
to mi&#383;take the &#383;ign for the thing it&#383;elf;
nor is any practice more frequent than
that of endeavouring to acquire the
exterior mark, without once thinking
to labour after the interior grace. Surely
this is beginning at the wrong end,
like attacking the &#383;ymptom and neglecting
the di&#383;ea&#383;e. To regulate the
features, while the &#383;oul is in tumults,
or to command the voice while the
pa&#383;&#383;ions are without re&#383;traint, is as idle
as throwing odours into a &#383;tream when

The former is univer&#383;al and habitual,
the latter, local and temporary. Every
young female may keep this rule by
her, to enable her to form a ju&#383;t judgment
of her own temper: if &#383;he is not

an over-acted &#383;oftne&#383;s, which, from its

u&#383;e of &#383;peech and motion, or
which, as Hamlet &#383;ays, makes them
li&#383;p and amble, and nick-name God's
creatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> countenance and manners of
&#383;ome very fa&#383;hionable per&#383;ons may be
compared to the in&#383;criptions on their
monuments, which &#383;peak nothing but
good of what is within; but he who
knows any thing of the world, or of
the human heart, will no more tru&#383;t
to the courte&#383;y, than he will depend
on the epitaph.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[p 113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the various artifices of factitious
meekne&#383;s, one of the mo&#383;t frequent
and mo&#383;t plau&#383;ible, is that of
affecting to be always equally delighted
with all per&#383;ons and all characters. The
&#383;ociety of the&#383;e languid beings is without
confidence, their friend&#383;hip without
attachment, and their love without
affection, or even preference. This
in&#383;ipid mode of conduct may be &#383;afe,
but I cannot think it has either ta&#383;te,
&#383;en&#383;e, or principle in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> uniformly &#383;miling and approving
ladies, who have neither the
noble courage to reprehend vice, nor
the generous warmth to bear their hone&#383;t
te&#383;timony in the cau&#383;e of virtue,
conclude every one to be ill-natured
who has any penetration, and look upon
a di&#383;tingui&#383;hing judgment as want
of tenderne&#383;s. But they &#383;hould learn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[p 114]</a></span>
that this di&#383;cernment does not always
proceed from an uncharitable temper,
but from that long experience and
thorough knowledge of the world,
which lead tho&#383;e who have it to &#383;crutinize
into the conduct and di&#383;po&#383;ition
of men, before they tru&#383;t entirely to
tho&#383;e fair appearances, which &#383;ometimes
veil the mo&#383;t in&#383;idious purpo&#383;es.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are perpetually mi&#383;taking the
qualities and di&#383;po&#383;itions of our own
hearts. We elevate our failings into
virtues, and qualify our vices into
weakne&#383;&#383;es: and hence ari&#383;e &#383;o many
fal&#383;e judgments re&#383;pecting meekne&#383;s.
Self-ignorance is at the root of all this
mi&#383;chief. Many ladies complain that,
for their part, their &#383;pirit is &#383;o meek
they can bear nothing; whereas, if
they &#383;poke truth, they would &#383;ay, their
&#383;pirit is &#383;o high and unbroken that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[p 115]</a></span>
they can bear nothing. Strange! to
plead their meekne&#383;s as a rea&#383;on why
they cannot endure to be cro&#383;&#383;ed, and
to produce their impatience of contradiction
as a proof of their gentlene&#383;s!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meekness</span>, like mo&#383;t other virtues,
has certain limits, which it no &#383;ooner
exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility
of &#383;pirit is not gentlene&#383;s but
weakne&#383;s, and if allowed, under the
&#383;pecious appearances it &#383;ometimes puts
on, will lead to the mo&#383;t dangerous
compliances. She who hears innocence
maligned without vindicating it,
fal&#383;ehood a&#383;&#383;erted without contradicting
it, or religion prophaned without
re&#383;enting it, is not gentle but wicked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> give up the cau&#383;e of an innocent,
injured friend, if the popular cry happens
to be again&#383;t him, is the mo&#383;t<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[p 116]</a></span>
di&#383;graceful weakne&#383;s. This was the
ca&#383;e of Madame de Maintenon. She
loved the character and admired the
talents of Racine; &#383;he care&#383;&#383;ed him
while he had no enemies, but wanted
the greatne&#383;s of mind, or rather the
common ju&#383;tice, to protect him again&#383;t
their re&#383;entment when he had; and
her favourite was abandoned to the
&#383;u&#383;picious jealou&#383;y of the king, when
a prudent remon&#383;trance might have
pre&#383;erved him.&mdash;But her tamene&#383;s, if
not ab&#383;olute connivance in the great
ma&#383;&#383;acre of the prote&#383;tants, in who&#383;e
church &#383;he had been bred, is a far
more guilty in&#383;tance of her weakne&#383;s;
an in&#383;tance which, in &#383;pite of all her
devotional zeal and incomparable prudence,
will di&#383;qualify her from &#383;hining
in the annals of good women, however
&#383;he may be entitled to figure
among the great and the fortunate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[p 117]</a></span>
Compare her conduct with that of her
undaunted and pious countryman and
contemporary, Bougi, who, when
Louis would have prevailed on him
to renounce his religion for a commi&#383;&#383;ion
or a government, nobly replied,
"If I could be per&#383;uaded to betray
my God for a mar&#383;hal's &#383;taff, I
might betray my king for a bribe
of much le&#383;s con&#383;equence."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meekness</span> is imperfect, if it be not
both active and pa&#383;&#383;ive; if it will not
enable us to &#383;ubdue our own pa&#383;&#383;ions
and re&#383;entments, as well as qualify us
to bear patiently the pa&#383;&#383;ions and re&#383;entments
of others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we give way to any violent
emotion of anger, it would perhaps be
worth while to con&#383;ider the value of
the object which excites it, and to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[p 118]</a></span>flect
for a moment, whether the thing
we &#383;o ardently de&#383;ire, or &#383;o vehemently
re&#383;ent, be really of as much importance
to us, as that delightful tranquillity
of &#383;oul, which we renounce in
pur&#383;uit of it. If, on a fair calculation,
we find we are not likely to get as
much as we are &#383;ure to lo&#383;e, then,
putting all religious con&#383;iderations out
of the que&#383;tion, common &#383;en&#383;e and
human policy will tell us, we have
made a fooli&#383;h and unprofitable exchange.
Inward quiet is a part of
one's &#383;elf; the object of our re&#383;entment
may be only a matter of opinion; and,
certainly, what makes a portion of
our actual happine&#383;s ought to be too
dear to us, to be &#383;acrificed for a trifling,
foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mo&#383;t pointed &#383;atire I remember
to have read, on a mind en&#383;laved by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[p 119]</a></span>
anger, is an ob&#383;ervation of Seneca's.
"Alexander (&#383;aid he) had two friends,
Clitus and Ly&#383;imachus; the one he
expo&#383;ed to a lion, the other to him&#383;elf:
he who was turned loo&#383;e to the
bea&#383;t e&#383;caped, but Clitus was murdered,
for he was turned loo&#383;e to an
angry man."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A passionate</span> woman's happine&#383;s
is never in her own keeping: it is the
&#383;port of accident, and the &#383;lave of
events. It is in the power of her acquaintance,
her &#383;ervants, but chiefly
of her enemies, and all her comforts
lie at the mercy of others. So far
from being willing to learn of him
who was meek and lowly, &#383;he con&#383;iders
meekne&#383;s as the want of a becoming
&#383;pirit, and lowline&#383;s as a de&#383;picable
and vulgar meanne&#383;s. And an imperious
woman will &#383;o little covet the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[p 120]</a></span>
ornament of a meek and quiet &#383;pirit,
that it is almo&#383;t the only ornament &#383;he
will not be &#383;olicitous to wear. But re&#383;entment
is a very expen&#383;ive vice. How
dearly has it co&#383;t its votaries, even
from the &#383;in of Cain, the fir&#383;t offender
in this kind! "It is cheaper (&#383;ays a
pious writer) to forgive, and &#383;ave
the charges."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it were only for mere human rea&#383;ons,
it would turn to a better account
to be patient; nothing defeats the malice
of an enemy like a &#383;pirit of forbearance;
the return of rage for rage
cannot be &#383;o effectually provoking.
True gentlene&#383;s, like an impenetrable
armour, repels the mo&#383;t pointed &#383;hafts
of malice: they cannot pierce through
this invulnerable &#383;hield, but either fall
hurtle&#383;s to the ground, or return to
wound the hand that &#383;hot them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[p 121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A meek</span> &#383;pirit will not look out of it&#383;elf
for happine&#383;s, becau&#383;e it finds a
con&#383;tant banquet at home; yet, by a
&#383;ort of divine alchymy, it will convert
all external events to its own profit,
and be able to deduce &#383;ome good, even
from the mo&#383;t unpromi&#383;ing: it will extract
comfort and &#383;ati&#383;faction from the
mo&#383;t barren circum&#383;tances: "It will
&#383;uck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the flinty rock."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the &#383;upreme excellence of this
complacent quality is, that it naturally
di&#383;po&#383;es the mind where it re&#383;ides, to
the practice of every other that is amiable.
Meekne&#383;s may be called the
pioneer of all the other virtues, which
levels every ob&#383;truction, and &#383;mooths
every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progre&#383;s.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[p 122]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> peculiar importance and value
of this amiable virtue may be farther
&#383;een in its permanency. Honours and
dignities are tran&#383;ient, beauty and
riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb.
Would not the truly wi&#383;e,
therefore, wi&#383;h to have &#383;ome one po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion,
which they might call their own
in the &#383;evere&#383;t exigencies? But this
wi&#383;h can only be accompli&#383;hed by acquiring
and maintaining that calm and
ab&#383;olute &#383;elf-po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion, which, as the
world had no hand in giving, &#383;o it
cannot, by the mo&#383;t malicious exertion
of its power, take away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[p 123]</a></span></p>

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> not the fooli&#383;h pre&#383;umption
to imagine, that I can offer
any thing new on a &#383;ubject, which
has been &#383;o &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;fully treated by
many learned and able writers. I would
only, with all po&#383;&#383;ible deference, beg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[p 124]</a></span>
leave to hazard a few &#383;hort remarks
on that part of the &#383;ubject of education,
which I would call the <i>education
of the heart</i>. I am well aware, that
this part al&#383;o has not been le&#383;s &#383;kilfully
and forcibly di&#383;cu&#383;&#383;ed than the
re&#383;t, though I cannot, at the &#383;ame
time, help remarking, that it does
not appear to have been &#383;o much
adopted into common practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears then, that notwith&#383;tanding
the great and real improvements,
which have been made in the affair
of female education, and notwith&#383;tanding
the more enlarged and generous
views of it, which prevail in the pre&#383;ent
day, that there is &#383;till a very material
defect, which it is not, in general,
enough the object of attention to remove.
This defect &#383;eems to con&#383;i&#383;t
in this, that too little regard is paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[p 125]</a></span>
to the di&#383;po&#383;itions of the <i>mind</i>, that
the indications of the <i>temper</i> are not
properly cheri&#383;hed, nor the affections
of the <i>heart</i> &#383;ufficiently regulated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the fir&#383;t education of girls, as
far as the cu&#383;toms which fa&#383;hion e&#383;tabli&#383;hes
are right, they &#383;hould undoubtedly
be followed. Let the exterior be
made a con&#383;iderable object of attention,
but let it not be the principal, let it
not be the only one.&mdash;Let the graces
be indu&#383;triou&#383;ly cultivated, but let
them not be cultivated at the expence
of the virtues.&mdash;Let the arms, the
head, the whole per&#383;on be carefully
poli&#383;hed, but let not the heart be the
only portion of the human anatomy,
which &#383;hall be totally overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> neglect of this cultivation &#383;eems
to proceed as much from a bad ta&#383;te,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[p 126]</a></span>
as from a fal&#383;e principle. The generality
of people form their judgment
of education by &#383;light and &#383;udden appearances,
which is certainly a wrong
way of determining. Mu&#383;ic, dancing,
and languages, gratify tho&#383;e who teach
them, by perceptible and almo&#383;t immediate
effects; and when there happens
to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor
deficiency in the matter, every &#383;uperficial
ob&#383;erver can, in &#383;ome mea&#383;ure,
judge of the progre&#383;s.&mdash;The effects of
mo&#383;t of the&#383;e accompli&#383;hments addre&#383;s
them&#383;elves to the &#383;en&#383;es; and there are
more who can &#383;ee and hear, than there
are who can judge and reflect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Personal</span> perfection is not only
more obvious, it is al&#383;o more rapid;
and even in very accompli&#383;hed characters,
elegance u&#383;ually precedes principle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[p 127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the heart, that natural &#383;eat of
evil propen&#383;ities, that little trouble&#383;ome
empire of the pa&#383;&#383;ions, is led to
what is right by &#383;low motions and imperceptible
degrees. It mu&#383;t be admoni&#383;hed
by reproof, and allured by
kindne&#383;s. Its livelie&#383;t advances are
frequently impeded by the ob&#383;tinacy
of prejudice, and its brighte&#383;t promi&#383;es
often ob&#383;cured by the tempe&#383;ts
of pa&#383;&#383;ion. It is &#383;low in its acqui&#383;ition
of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches
to piety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another rea&#383;on, which
proves this mental cultivation to be
more important, as well as more difficult,
than any other part of education.
In the u&#383;ual fa&#383;hionable accompli&#383;hments,
the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of acquiring them
is almo&#383;t always getting forwards, and
one difficulty is conquered before an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[p 128]</a></span>other
is &#383;uffered to &#383;hew it&#383;elf; for a
prudent teacher will level the road his
pupil is to pa&#383;s, and &#383;mooth the inequalities
which might retard her progre&#383;s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in morals, (which &#383;hould be
the great object con&#383;tantly kept in
view) the talk is far more difficult.
The unruly and turbulent de&#383;ires of
the heart are not &#383;o obedient; one pa&#383;&#383;ion
will &#383;tart up before another is &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed.
The &#383;ubduing Hercules cannot
cut off the heads &#383;o often as the
prolific Hydra can produce them, nor
fell the &#383;tubborn Ant&aelig;us &#383;o fa&#383;t as he
can recruit his &#383;trength, and ri&#383;e in
vigorous and repeated oppo&#383;ition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> all the accompli&#383;hments could be
bought at the price of a &#383;ingle virtue,
the purcha&#383;e would be infinitely dear!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[p 129]</a></span>
And, however &#383;tartling it may &#383;ound,
I think it is, notwith&#383;tanding, true,
that the labours of a good and wi&#383;e
mother, who is anxious for her daughter's
mo&#383;t important intere&#383;ts, will <i>&#383;eem</i>
to be at variance with tho&#383;e of her in&#383;tructors.
She will doubtle&#383;s rejoice
at her progre&#383;s in any polite art, but
&#383;he will rejoice with trembling:&mdash;humility
and piety form the &#383;olid and
durable ba&#383;is, on which &#383;he wi&#383;hes to
rai&#383;e the &#383;uper&#383;tructure of the accompli&#383;hments,
while the accompli&#383;hments
them&#383;elves are frequently of that un&#383;teady
nature, that if the foundation
is not &#383;ecured, in proportion as the
building is enlarged, it will be overloaded
and de&#383;troyed by tho&#383;e very
ornaments, which were intended to
embelli&#383;h, what they have contributed
to ruin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[p 130]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> more o&#383;ten&#383;ible qualifications
&#383;hould be carefully regulated, or they
will be in danger of putting to flight
the mode&#383;t train of retreating virtues,
which cannot &#383;afely &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t before the
bold eye of public ob&#383;ervation, or
bear the bolder tongue of impudent
and audacious flattery. A tender mother
cannot but feel an hone&#383;t triumph,
in contemplating tho&#383;e excellencies in
her daughter which de&#383;erve applau&#383;e,
but &#383;he will al&#383;o &#383;hudder at the vanity
which that applau&#383;e may excite, and
at tho&#383;e hitherto unknown ideas which
it may awaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ma&#383;ter, it is his intere&#383;t, and
perhaps his duty, will naturally teach
a girl to &#383;et her improvements in the
mo&#383;t con&#383;picuous point of light. <span class="smcap">Se
faire valoir</span> is the great principle
indu&#383;triou&#383;ly inculcated into her young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[p 131]</a></span>
heart, and &#383;eems to be con&#383;idered as
a kind of fundamental maxim in education.
It is however the certain and
effectual &#383;eed, from which a thou&#383;and
yet unborn vanities will &#383;pring. This
dangerous doctrine (which yet is not
without its u&#383;es) will be counteracted
by the prudent mother, not in &#383;o
many words, but by a watchful and
&#383;carcely perceptible dexterity. Such
an one will be more careful to have
the talents of her daughter <i>cultivated</i>
than <i>exhibited</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> would be led to imagine, by
the common mode of female education,
that life con&#383;i&#383;ted of one univer&#383;al
holiday, and that the only conte&#383;t
was, who &#383;hould be be&#383;t enabled
to excel in the &#383;ports and games that
were to be celebrated on it. Merely
ornamental accompli&#383;hments will but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[p 132]</a></span>
indifferently qualify a woman to perform
the <i>duties</i> of life, though it is
highly proper &#383;he &#383;hould po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s them,
in order to furni&#383;h the <i>amu&#383;ements</i> of
it. But is it right to &#383;pend &#383;o large
a portion of life without &#383;ome preparation
for the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of living? A
lady may &#383;peak a little French and
Italian, repeat a few pa&#383;&#383;ages in a theatrical
tone, play and &#383;ing, have her
dre&#383;&#383;ing-room hung with her own drawings,
and her per&#383;on covered with her
own tambour work, and may, notwith&#383;tanding,
have been very <i>badly
educated</i>. Yet I am far from attempting
to depreciate the value of the&#383;e
qualifications: they are mo&#383;t of them
not only highly becoming, but often
indi&#383;pen&#383;ably nece&#383;&#383;ary, and a polite
education cannot be perfected without
them. But as the world &#383;eems to
be very well appri&#383;ed of their import<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[p 133]</a></span>ance,
there is the le&#383;s occa&#383;ion to in&#383;i&#383;t
on their utility. Yet, though well-bred
young women &#383;hould learn to
dance, &#383;ing, recite and draw, the end
of a good education is not that they
may become dancers, &#383;ingers, players
or painters: its real object is to make
them good daughters, good wives,
good mi&#383;tre&#383;&#383;es, good members of &#383;ociety,
and good chri&#383;tians. The above
qualifications therefore are intended to
<i>adorn</i> their <i>lei&#383;ure</i>, not to <i>employ</i> their
<i>lives</i>; for an amiable and wi&#383;e woman
will always have &#383;omething better to
value her&#383;elf on, than the&#383;e advantages,
which, however captivating,
are &#383;till but &#383;ubordinate parts of a truly
excellent character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> I am afraid parents them&#383;elves
&#383;ometimes contribute to the error of
which I am complaining. Do they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[p 134]</a></span>
not often &#383;et a higher value on tho&#383;e
acqui&#383;itions which are calculated to
attract ob&#383;ervation, and catch the eye
of the multitude, than on tho&#383;e which
are valuable, permanent, and internal?
Are they not &#383;ometimes more &#383;olicitous
about the opinion of others, re&#383;pecting
their children, than about
the real advantage and happine&#383;s of
the children them&#383;elves? To an injudicious
and &#383;uperficial eye, the be&#383;t
educated girl may make the lea&#383;t brilliant
figure, as &#383;he will probably have
le&#383;s flippancy in her manner, and le&#383;s
repartee in her expre&#383;&#383;ion; and her acquirements,
to borrow bi&#383;hop Sprat's
idea, will be rather <i>enamelled than embo&#383;&#383;ed</i>.
But her merit will be known,
and acknowledged by all who come
near enough to di&#383;cern, and have ta&#383;te
enough to di&#383;tingui&#383;h. It will be under&#383;tood

who&#383;e happine&#383;s &#383;he is one day to
make, who&#383;e family &#383;he is to govern,
and who&#383;e children &#383;he is to educate.
He will not &#383;eek for her in the haunts
of di&#383;&#383;ipation, for he knows he &#383;hall
not find her there; but he will &#383;eek
for her in the bo&#383;om of retirement, in
the practice of every dome&#383;tic virtue,
in the exertion of every amiable accompli&#383;hment,
exerted in the &#383;hade, to
enliven retirement, to heighten the
endearing plea&#383;ures of &#383;ocial intercour&#383;e,
and to embelli&#383;h the narrow
but charming circle of family delights.
To this amiable purpo&#383;e, a truly good
and well educated young lady will dedicate
her more elegant accompli&#383;hments,
in&#383;tead of exhibiting them to attract
admiration, or depre&#383;s inferiority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> girls, who have more vivacity
than under&#383;tanding, will often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[p 136]</a></span>
make a &#383;prightly figure in conver&#383;ation.
But this agreeable talent for entertaining
others, is frequently dangerous to
them&#383;elves, nor is it by any means to
be de&#383;ired or encouraged very early in
life. This immaturity of wit is helped
on by frivolous reading, which will
produce its effect in much le&#383;s time
than books of &#383;olid in&#383;truction; for the
imagination is touched &#383;ooner than the
under&#383;tanding; and effects are more
rapid as they are more pernicious.
Conver&#383;ation &#383;hould be the <i>re&#383;ult</i> of
education, not the <i>precur&#383;or</i> of it. It
is a golden fruit, when &#383;uffered to
grow gradually on the tree of knowledge;
but if precipitated by forced
and unnatural means, it will in the
end become vapid, in proportion as it
is artificial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[p 137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> be&#383;t effects of a careful and
religious education are often very remote:
they are to be di&#383;covered in
future &#383;cenes, and exhibited in untried
connexions. Every event of life will
be putting the heart into fre&#383;h &#383;ituations,
and making demands on its
prudence, its firmne&#383;s, its integrity,
or its piety. Tho&#383;e who&#383;e bu&#383;ine&#383;s it
is to form it, can fore&#383;ee none of the&#383;e
&#383;ituations; yet, as far as human wi&#383;dom
will allow, they mu&#383;t enable it
to provide for them all, with an humble
dependence on the divine a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance.
A well-di&#383;ciplined &#383;oldier mu&#383;t learn
and practi&#383;e all his evolutions, though
he does not know on what &#383;ervice his
leader may command him, by what
foe he &#383;hall be attacked, nor what
mode of combat the enemy may
u&#383;e.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[p 138]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> great art of education con&#383;i&#383;ts
in not &#383;uffering the feelings to become
too acute by unnece&#383;&#383;ary awakening,
nor too obtu&#383;e by the want of exertion.
The former renders them the &#383;ource
of calamity, and totally ruins the temper;
while the latter blunts and deba&#383;es
them, and produces a dull, cold,
and &#383;elfi&#383;h &#383;pirit. For the mind is an
in&#383;trument, which, if wound too high,
will lo&#383;e its &#383;weetne&#383;s, and if not
enough &#383;trained, will abate of its vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> cruel is it to extingui&#383;h by
neglect or unkindne&#383;s, the precious
&#383;en&#383;ibility of an open temper, to chill
the amiable glow of an ingenuous &#383;oul,
and to quench the bright flame of a
noble and generous &#383;pirit! The&#383;e are
of higher worth than all the documents
of learning, of dearer price than all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[p 139]</a></span>
the advantages, which can be derived
from the mo&#383;t refined and artificial
mode of education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> &#383;en&#383;ibility and delicacy, and an
ingenuous temper, make no part of
education, exclaims the pedagogue&mdash;they
are reducible to no cla&#383;s&mdash;they
come under no article of in&#383;truction&mdash;they
belong neither to languages nor
to mu&#383;ic.&mdash;What an error! They <i>are</i>
a part of education, and of infinitely
more value,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Than all their pedant di&#383;cipline e'er knew.<br /></span>

<p>It is true, they are ranged under no
cla&#383;s, but they are &#383;uperior to all;
they are of more e&#383;teem than languages
or mu&#383;ic, for they are the language of
the heart, and the mu&#383;ic of the according
pa&#383;&#383;ions. Yet this &#383;en&#383;ibility is,
in many in&#383;tances, &#383;o far from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[p 140]</a></span>
cultivated, that it is not uncommon
to &#383;ee tho&#383;e who affect more than u&#383;ual
&#383;agacity, ca&#383;t a &#383;mile of &#383;upercilious
pity, at any indication of a warm,
generous, or enthu&#383;ia&#383;tic temper in the
lively and the young; as much as to
&#383;ay, "they will know better, and will
have more di&#383;cretion when they are
older." But every appearance of
amiable &#383;implicity, or of hone&#383;t &#383;hame,
<i>Nature's ha&#383;ty con&#383;cience</i>, will be dear
to &#383;en&#383;ible hearts; they will carefully
cheri&#383;h every &#383;uch indication in a
young female; for they will perceive
that it is this temper, wi&#383;ely cultivated,
which will one day make her
enamoured of the loveline&#383;s of virtue,
and the beauty of holine&#383;s: from
which &#383;he will acquire a ta&#383;te for the
doctrines of religion, and a &#383;pirit to
perform the duties of it. And tho&#383;e
who wi&#383;h to make her a&#383;hamed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[p 141]</a></span>
this charming temper, and &#383;eek to di&#383;po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s
her of it, will, it is to be feared,
give her nothing better in exchange.
But whoever reflects at all, will ea&#383;ily
di&#383;cern how carefully this enthu&#383;ia&#383;m
is to be directed, and how judiciou&#383;ly
its redundances are to be lopped
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> is not natural to children;
they can, however, &#383;ub&#383;titute
art in its &#383;tead. But is it not much
better that a girl &#383;hould di&#383;cover the
faults incident to her age, than conceal
them under this dark and impenetrable
veil? I could almo&#383;t venture
to a&#383;&#383;ert, that there is &#383;omething more
becoming in the very errors of nature,
where they are undi&#383;gui&#383;ed, than in the
affectation of virtue it&#383;elf, where the
reality is wanting. And I am &#383;o far
from being an admirer of prodigies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[p 142]</a></span>
that I am extremely apt to &#383;u&#383;pect
them; and am always infinitely better
plea&#383;ed with Nature in her more common
modes of operation. The preci&#383;e
and premature wi&#383;dom, which &#383;ome
girls have cunning enough to a&#383;&#383;ume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than
any of their natural failings can be,
as it effectually covers tho&#383;e &#383;ecret bad
di&#383;po&#383;itions, which, if they di&#383;played
them&#383;elves, might be rectified. The
hypocri&#383;y of a&#383;&#383;uming virtues which
are not inherent in the heart, prevents
the growth and di&#383;clo&#383;ure of tho&#383;e real
ones, which it is the great end of education
to cultivate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if the natural indications of the
temper are to be &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed and &#383;tifled,
where are the diagno&#383;tics, by which
the &#383;tate of the mind is to be known?
The wi&#383;e Author of all things, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[p 143]</a></span>
did nothing in vain, doubtle&#383;s intended
them as &#383;ymptoms, by which to
judge of the di&#383;ea&#383;es of the heart;
and it is impo&#383;&#383;ible di&#383;ea&#383;es &#383;hould be
cured before they are known. If the
&#383;tream be &#383;o cut off as to prevent communication,
or &#383;o choked up as to
defeat di&#383;covery, how &#383;hall we ever
reach the &#383;ource, out of which are the
i&#383;&#383;ues of life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> cunning, which, of all the
different di&#383;po&#383;itions girls di&#383;cover, is
mo&#383;t to be dreaded, is increa&#383;ed by
nothing &#383;o much as by fear. If tho&#383;e
about them expre&#383;s violent and unrea&#383;onable
anger at every trivial offence,
it will always promote this temper,
and will very frequently create it,
where there was a natural tendency to
frankne&#383;s. The indi&#383;creet tran&#383;ports
of rage, which many betray on every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[p 144]</a></span>
&#383;light occa&#383;ion, and the little di&#383;tinction
they make between venial errors
and premeditated crimes, naturally
di&#383;po&#383;e a child to conceal, what &#383;he
does not however care to &#383;uppre&#383;s.
Anger in one will not remedy the faults
of another; for how can an in&#383;trument
of &#383;in cure &#383;in? If a girl is kept in
a &#383;tate of perpetual and &#383;lavi&#383;h terror,
&#383;he will perhaps have artifice enough
to conceal tho&#383;e propen&#383;ities which
&#383;he knows are wrong, or tho&#383;e actions
which &#383;he thinks are mo&#383;t obnoxious
to puni&#383;hment. But, neverthele&#383;s, &#383;he
will not cea&#383;e to indulge tho&#383;e propen&#383;ities,
and to commit tho&#383;e actions,
when &#383;he can do it with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> <i>di&#383;po&#383;itions</i>, of them&#383;elves, will
go but a very little way, unle&#383;s they
are confirmed into good <i>principles</i>.
And this cannot be effected but by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[p 145]</a></span>
careful cour&#383;e of religious in&#383;truction,
and a patient and laborious cultivation
of the moral temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, notwith&#383;tanding girls &#383;hould
not be treated with unkindne&#383;s, nor
the fir&#383;t openings of the pa&#383;&#383;ions blighted
by cold &#383;everity; yet I am of opinion,
that young females &#383;hould be
accu&#383;tomed very early in life to a certain
degree of re&#383;traint. The natural
ca&#383;t of character, and the moral di&#383;tinctions
between the &#383;exes, &#383;hould
not be di&#383;regarded, even in childhood.
That bold, independent, enterpri&#383;ing
&#383;pirit, which is &#383;o much admired in
boys, &#383;hould not, when it happens to
di&#383;cover it&#383;elf in the other &#383;ex, be encouraged,
but &#383;uppre&#383;&#383;ed. Girls &#383;hould
be taught to give up their opinions
betimes, and not pertinaciou&#383;ly to carry
on a di&#383;pute, even if they &#383;hould<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[p 146]</a></span>
know them&#383;elves to be in the right.
I do not mean, that they &#383;hould be
robbed of the liberty of private judgment,
but that they &#383;hould by no
means be encouraged to contract a
contentious or contradictory turn. It
is of the greate&#383;t importance to their
future happine&#383;s, that they &#383;hould acquire
a &#383;ubmi&#383;&#383;ive temper, and a forbearing
&#383;pirit: for it is a le&#383;&#383;on which
the world will not fail to make them
frequently practi&#383;e, when they come
abroad into it, and they will not practi&#383;e
it the wor&#383;e for having learnt it
the &#383;ooner. The&#383;e early re&#383;traints, in
the limitation here meant, are &#383;o far
from being an effect of cruelty, that
they are the mo&#383;t indubitable marks of
affection, and are the more meritorious,
as they are &#383;evere trials of tenderne&#383;s.
But all the beneficial effects, which a
mother can expect from this watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[p 147]</a></span>fulne&#383;s,
will be entirely defeated, if
it is practi&#383;ed occa&#383;ionally, and not
habitually, and if it ever appears to
be u&#383;ed to gratify caprice, ill-humour,
or re&#383;entment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have children to educate
ought to be extremely patient:
it is indeed a labour of love. They
&#383;hould reflect, that extraordinary talents
are neither e&#383;&#383;ential to the well-being
of &#383;ociety, nor to the happine&#383;s
of individuals. If that had been the
ca&#383;e, the beneficent Father of the univer&#383;e
would not have made them &#383;o
rare. For it is as ea&#383;y for an Almighty
Creator to produce a Newton, as an
ordinary man; and he could have made
tho&#383;e powers common which we now
con&#383;ider as wonderful, without any
miraculous exertion of his omnipotence,
if the exi&#383;tence of many New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[p 148]</a></span>tons
had been nece&#383;&#383;ary to the perfection
of his wi&#383;e and gracious plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surely</span>, therefore, there is more
piety, as well as more &#383;en&#383;e, in labouring
to improve the talents which children
actually have, than in lamenting
that they do not po&#383;&#383;e&#383;s &#383;upernatural
endowments or angelic perfections. A
pa&#383;&#383;age of Lord Bacon's furni&#383;hes an
admirable incitement for endeavouring
to carry the amiable and chri&#383;tian
grace of charity to its farthe&#383;t extent,
in&#383;tead of indulging an over-anxious
care for more brilliant but le&#383;s important
acqui&#383;itions. "The de&#383;ire of
power in exce&#383;s (&#383;ays he) cau&#383;ed the
angels to fall; the de&#383;ire of knowledge
in exce&#383;s cau&#383;ed man to fall;
but in charity is no exce&#383;s, neither
can men nor angels come into danger
by it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[p 149]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A girl</span> who has docility will &#383;eldom
be found to want under&#383;tanding enough
for all the purpo&#383;es of a &#383;ocial, a happy,
and an u&#383;eful life. And when
we behold the tender hope of fond
and anxious love, bla&#383;ted by di&#383;appointment,
the defect will as often be
di&#383;covered to proceed from the neglect
or the error of cultivation, as from the
natural temper; and tho&#383;e who lament
the evil, will &#383;ometimes be found to
have occa&#383;ioned it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is as injudicious for parents to &#383;et
out with too &#383;anguine a dependence
on the merit of their children, as it is
for them to be di&#383;couraged at every
repul&#383;e. When their wi&#383;hes are defeated
in this or that particular in&#383;tance,
where they had trea&#383;ured up
&#383;ome darling expectation, this is &#383;o far
from being a rea&#383;on for relaxing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[p 150]</a></span>
attention, that it ought to be an additional
motive for redoubling it. Tho&#383;e
who hope to do a great deal, mu&#383;t not
expect to do every thing. If they
know any thing of the malignity of
&#383;in, the blindne&#383;s of prejudice, or the
corruption of the human heart, they
will al&#383;o know, that that heart will always
remain, after the very be&#383;t po&#383;&#383;ible
education, full of infirmity and imperfection.
Extraordinary allowances, therefore,
mu&#383;t be made for the weakne&#383;s
of nature in this its weake&#383;t &#383;tate. After
much is done, much will remain to
do, and much, very much, will &#383;till
be left undone. For this regulation
of the pa&#383;&#383;ions and affections cannot
be the work of education alone, without
the concurrence of divine grace
operating on the heart. Why then
&#383;hould parents repine, if their efforts
are not always crowned with imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[p 151]</a></span>diate
&#383;ucce&#383;s? They &#383;hould con&#383;ider,
that they are not educating cherubims
and &#383;eraphims, but men and women;
creatures, who at their be&#383;t e&#383;tate are altogether
vanity: how little then can be
expected from them in the weakne&#383;s
and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt
on this part of the &#383;ubject the longer,
becau&#383;e I am certain that many, who
have &#383;et out with a warm and active
zeal, have cooled on the very fir&#383;t
di&#383;couragement, and have afterwards
almo&#383;t totally remitted their vigilance,
through a criminal kind of de&#383;pair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> allowances mu&#383;t be made
for a profu&#383;ion of gaiety, loquacity,
and even indi&#383;cretion in children, that
there may be animation enough left to

<p>it is al&#383;o true, that there is &#383;carcely a

to &#383;ome good account, if prudently
rectified, and &#383;kilfully turned into the
road of &#383;ome neighbouring virtue. It
cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally
forced towards an object of a
totally oppo&#383;ite nature, but may be
gradually inclined towards a corre&#383;pondent
but &#383;uperior affection. Anger,
hatred, re&#383;entment, and ambition, the

which &#383;hake and di&#383;tract the human

been its mo&#383;t &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ful in&#383;truments.
Our anger, for in&#383;tance, which can

again&#383;t every &#383;pecies of vice&mdash;our ambition,
which will not be di&#383;carded,
may be ennobled: it will not change
its name, but its object: it will de&#383;pi&#383;e
what it lately valued, nor be
contented to gra&#383;p at le&#383;s than immortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> the joys, fears, hopes, de&#383;ires,
all the pa&#383;&#383;ions and affections, which
&#383;eparate in various currents from the
&#383;oul, will, if directed into their proper
channels, after having fertili&#383;ed
wherever they have flowed, return
again to &#383;well and enrich the parent
&#383;ource.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[p 154]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the very pa&#383;&#383;ions which appear
the mo&#383;t uncontroulable and unpromi&#383;ing,
may be intended, in the great
&#383;cheme of Providence, to an&#383;wer &#383;ome
important purpo&#383;e, is remarkably evidenced
in the character and hi&#383;tory
of Saint Paul. A remark on this &#383;ubject
by an ingenious old Spani&#383;h writer,
which I will here take the liberty
to tran&#383;late, will better illu&#383;trate my
meaning.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To</span> convert the bittere&#383;t enemy
into the mo&#383;t zealous advocate, is
the work of God for the in&#383;truction
of man. Plutarch has ob&#383;erved,
that the medical &#383;cience would be
brought to the utmo&#383;t perfection,
when poi&#383;on &#383;hould be converted
into phy&#383;ic. Thus, in the mortal
di&#383;ea&#383;e of Judai&#383;m and idolatry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[p 155]</a></span>
our ble&#383;&#383;ed Lord converted the adder's
venom of Saul the per&#383;ecutor,
into that cement which made Paul
the cho&#383;en ve&#383;&#383;el. That manly activity,
that re&#383;tle&#383;s ardor, that
burning zeal for the law of his
fathers, that ardent thir&#383;t for the
blood of Chri&#383;tians, did the Son
of God find nece&#383;&#383;ary in the man
who was one day to become the
defender of his &#383;uffering people.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> win the pa&#383;&#383;ions, therefore, over
to the cau&#383;e of virtue, an&#383;wers a much
nobler end than their extinction would
po&#383;&#383;ibly do, even if that could be effected.
But it is their nature never
to ob&#383;erve a neutrality; they are either
rebels or auxiliaries, and an
enemy &#383;ubdued is an ally obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[p 156]</a></span>
If I may be allowed to change the allu&#383;ion
&#383;o &#383;oon, I would &#383;ay, that the
pa&#383;&#383;ions al&#383;o re&#383;emble fires, which are
friendly and beneficial when under proper
direction, but if &#383;uffered to blaze
without re&#383;traint, they carry deva&#383;tation
along with them, and, if totally extingui&#383;hed,
leave the benighted mind
in a &#383;tate of cold and comfortle&#383;s inanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in &#383;peaking of the u&#383;efulne&#383;s
of the pa&#383;&#383;ions, as in&#383;truments of virtue,
<i>envy</i> and <i>lying</i> mu&#383;t always be
excepted: the&#383;e, I am per&#383;uaded, mu&#383;t
either go on in &#383;till progre&#383;&#383;ive mi&#383;chief,
or el&#383;e be radically cured, before
any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with
them. For I never will believe that
envy, though pa&#383;&#383;ed through all the
moral &#383;trainers, can be refined into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[p 157]</a></span>
virtuous emulation, or lying improved
into an agreeable turn for innocent invention.
Almo&#383;t all the other pa&#383;&#383;ions
may be made to take an amiable
hue; but the&#383;e two mu&#383;t either be totally
extirpated, or be always contented
to pre&#383;erve their original deformity,
and to wear their native black.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Various</span> are the rea&#383;ons why
the greater part of mankind cannot
apply them&#383;elves to arts or letters.
Particular &#383;tudies are only &#383;uited to
the capacities of particular per&#383;ons.
Some are incapable of applying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[p 159]</a></span>
them from the delicacy of their &#383;ex,
&#383;ome from the un&#383;teadine&#383;s of youth,
and others from the imbecillity of age.
Many are precluded by the narrowne&#383;s
of their education, and many by
the &#383;traitne&#383;s of their fortune. The
wi&#383;dom of God is wonderfully manife&#383;ted
in this happy and well-ordered
diver&#383;ity, in the powers and properties
of his creatures; &#383;ince by thus admirably
&#383;uiting the agent to the action,
the whole &#383;cheme of human affairs is
carried on with the mo&#383;t agreeing and
con&#383;i&#383;tent [oe]conomy, and no cha&#383;m is
left for want of an object to fill it, exactly
&#383;uited to its nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in the great and univer&#383;al concern
of religion, both &#383;exes, and all
ranks, are equally intere&#383;ted. The
truly catholic &#383;pirit of chri&#383;tianity accommodates
it&#383;elf, with an a&#383;toni&#383;h<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[p 160]</a></span>ing
conde&#383;cen&#383;ion, to the circum&#383;tances
of the whole human race. It rejects
none on account of their pecuniary
wants, their per&#383;onal infirmities, or
their intellectual deficiencies. No &#383;uperiority
of parts is the lea&#383;t recommendation,
nor is any depre&#383;&#383;ion of
fortune the &#383;malle&#383;t objection. None
are too wi&#383;e to be excu&#383;ed from performing
the duties of religion, nor are
any too poor to be excluded from the
con&#383;olations of its promi&#383;es.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we admire the wi&#383;dom of God,
in having furni&#383;hed different degrees
of intelligence, &#383;o exactly adapted to
their different de&#383;tinations, and in having
fitted every part of his &#383;tupendous work,
not only to &#383;erve its own immediate
purpo&#383;e, but al&#383;o to contribute to the
beauty and perfection of the whole:
how much more ought we to adore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[p 161]</a></span>
that goodne&#383;s, which has perfected the
divine plan, by appointing one wide,
comprehen&#383;ive, and univer&#383;al means
of &#383;alvation: a &#383;alvation, which all
are invited to partake; by a means
which all are capable of u&#383;ing; which
nothing but voluntary blindne&#383;s can
prevent our comprehending, and nothing
but wilful error can hinder us
from embracing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mu&#383;es are coy, and will only
be wooed and won by &#383;ome highly-favoured
&#383;uitors. The Sciences are
lofty, and will not &#383;toop to the reach
of ordinary capacities. But "Wi&#383;dom
(by which the royal preacher
means piety) is a loving &#383;pirit: &#383;he
is ea&#383;ily &#383;een of them that love her,
and found of all &#383;uch as &#383;eek her."
Nay, &#383;he is &#383;o acce&#383;&#383;ible and conde&#383;cending,
"that &#383;he preventeth them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[p 162]</a></span>
that de&#383;ire her, making her&#383;elf fir&#383;t
known unto them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are told by the &#383;ame animated
writer, "that Wi&#383;dom is the breath
of the power of God." How infinitely
&#383;uperior, in grandeur and &#383;ublimity,
is this de&#383;cription to the origin
of the <i>wi&#383;dom</i> of the heathens, as de&#383;cribed
by their poets and mythologi&#383;ts!
In the exalted &#383;trains of the Hebrew
poetry we read, that "Wi&#383;dom is the
brightne&#383;s of the everla&#383;ting light,
the un&#383;potted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodne&#383;s."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> philo&#383;ophical author of <i>The
Defence of Learning</i> ob&#383;erves, that
knowledge has &#383;omething of venom
and malignity in it, when taken without
its proper corrective, and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[p 163]</a></span>
that is, the in&#383;pired Saint Paul teaches
us, by placing it as the immediate antidote:
<i>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth.</i> Perhaps, it is the vanity
of human wi&#383;dom, uncha&#383;ti&#383;ed by this
correcting principle, which has made
&#383;o many infidels. It may proceed from
the arrogance of a &#383;elf-&#383;ufficient pride,
that &#383;ome philo&#383;ophers di&#383;dain to acknowledge
their belief in a being, who
has judged proper to conceal from
them the infinite wi&#383;dom of his coun&#383;els;
who, (to borrow the lofty language
of the man of Uz) refu&#383;ed to
con&#383;ult them when he laid the foundations
of the earth, when he &#383;hut up
the &#383;ea with doors, and made the
clouds the garment thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> mu&#383;t be an infidel either
from pride, prejudice, or bad education:
he cannot be one unawares or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[p 164]</a></span>
by &#383;urpri&#383;e; for infidelity is not occa&#383;ioned
by &#383;udden impul&#383;e or violent
temptation. He may be hurried by
&#383;ome vehement de&#383;ire into an immoral
action, at which he will blu&#383;h in his
cooler moments, and which he will
lament as the &#383;ad effect of a &#383;pirit un&#383;ubdued
by religion; but infidelity is
a calm, con&#383;iderate act, which cannot
plead the weakne&#383;s of the heart, or
the &#383;eduction of the &#383;en&#383;es. Even
good men frequently fail in their duty
through the infirmities of nature, and
the allurements of the world; but the
infidel errs on a plan, on a &#383;ettled and
deliberate principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> though the minds of men are
&#383;ometimes fatally infected with this
di&#383;ea&#383;e, either through unhappy prepo&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;ion,
or &#383;ome of the other cau&#383;es
above mentioned; yet I am unwilling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[p 165]</a></span>
to believe, that there is in nature &#383;o
mon&#383;trou&#383;ly incongruous a being, as
a <i>female infidel</i>. The lea&#383;t reflexion on
the temper, the character, and the
education of women, makes the mind
revolt with horror from an idea &#383;o improbable,
and &#383;o unnatural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> I be allowed to ob&#383;erve, that,
in general, the minds of girls &#383;eem
more aptly prepared in their early
youth for the reception of &#383;erious
impre&#383;&#383;ions than tho&#383;e of the other &#383;ex,
and that their le&#383;s expo&#383;ed &#383;ituations
in more advanced life qualify them
better for the pre&#383;ervation of them?
The daughters (of good parents I
mean) are often more carefully in&#383;tructed
in their religious duties, than
the &#383;ons, and this from a variety of
cau&#383;es. They are not &#383;o &#383;oon &#383;ent
from under the paternal eye into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[p 166]</a></span>
bu&#383;tle of the world, and &#383;o early expo&#383;ed
to the contagion of bad example:
their hearts are naturally more
flexible, &#383;oft, and liable to any kind
of impre&#383;&#383;ion the forming hand may
&#383;tamp on them; and, la&#383;tly, as they
do not receive the &#383;ame cla&#383;&#383;ical education
with boys, their feeble minds
are not obliged at once to receive and
&#383;eparate the precepts of chri&#383;tianity,
and the documents of pagan philo&#383;ophy.
The nece&#383;&#383;ity of doing this perhaps
&#383;omewhat weakens the &#383;erious
impre&#383;&#383;ions of young men, at lea&#383;t till
the under&#383;tanding is formed, and confu&#383;es
their ideas of piety, by mixing
them with &#383;o much heterogeneous
matter. They only ca&#383;ually read, or
hear read, the &#383;criptures of truth,
while they are obliged to learn by
heart, con&#383;true and repeat the poetical
fables of the le&#383;s than human gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[p 167]</a></span>
of the ancients. And as the excellent author
of <i>The Internal Evidence of the Chri&#383;tian
Religion</i> ob&#383;erves, "Nothing has
&#383;o much contributed to corrupt the
true &#383;pirit of the chri&#383;tian in&#383;titution,
as that partiality which we contract,
in our earlie&#383;t education, for the
manners of pagan antiquity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls</span>, therefore, who do <i>not</i> contract
this early partiality, ought to
have a clearer notion of their religious
duties: they are not obliged, at an
age when the judgment is &#383;o weak,
to di&#383;tingui&#383;h between the doctrines
of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Christ;
and to embarra&#383;s their minds with the
various morals which were taught in
the <i>Porch</i>, in the <i>Academy</i>, and on the
<i>Mount</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[p 168]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is pre&#383;umed, that the&#383;e remarks
cannot po&#383;&#383;ibly be &#383;o mi&#383;under&#383;tood,
as to be con&#383;trued into the lea&#383;t di&#383;re&#383;pect
to literature, or a want of the
highe&#383;t reverence for a learned education,
the ba&#383;is of all elegant knowledge:
they are only intended, with
all proper deference, to point out to
young women, that however inferior
their advantages of acquiring a knowledge
of the belles-lettres are to tho&#383;e
of the other &#383;ex; yet it depends on
them&#383;elves not to be &#383;urpa&#383;&#383;ed in this
mo&#383;t important of all &#383;tudies, for
which their abilities are equal, and
their opportunities, perhaps, greater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the mere exemption from infidelity
is &#383;o &#383;mall a part of the religious
character, that I hope no one
will attempt to claim any merit from
this negative &#383;ort of goodne&#383;s, or va<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[p 169]</a></span>lue
her&#383;elf merely for not being the
very wor&#383;t thing &#383;he po&#383;&#383;ibly can be.
Let no mi&#383;taken girl fancy &#383;he gives
a proof of her wit by her want of piety,
or that a contempt of things &#383;erious
and &#383;acred will exalt her under&#383;tanding,
or rai&#383;e her character even in the
opinion of the mo&#383;t avowed male infidels.
For one may venture to affirm,
that with all their profligate ideas,
both of women and of religion, neither
Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham,
nor even <i>Lord Che&#383;terfield him&#383;elf</i>, would
have e&#383;teemed a woman the more for
her being irreligious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> whatever ridicule a polite
freethinker may affect to treat religion
him&#383;elf, he will think it nece&#383;&#383;ary his
wife &#383;hould entertain different notions
of it. He may pretend to de&#383;pi&#383;e it
as a matter of opinion, depending on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[p 170]</a></span>
creeds and &#383;y&#383;tems; but, if he is a
man of &#383;en&#383;e, he will know the value
of it, as a governing principle, which
is to influence her conduct and direct
her actions. If he &#383;ees her unaffectedly
&#383;incere in the practice of her religious
duties, it will be a &#383;ecret pledge
to him, that &#383;he will be equally exact
in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can
have no rea&#383;onable dependance on her
attachment to <i>him</i>, if he has no opinion
of her fidelity to <span class="smcap">God</span>; for &#383;he
who neglects fir&#383;t duties, gives but an
indifferent proof of her di&#383;po&#383;ition to
fill up inferior ones; and how can a
man of any under&#383;tanding (whatever
his own religious profe&#383;&#383;ions may be)
tru&#383;t that woman with the care of his
family, and the education of his children,
who wants her&#383;elf the be&#383;t incentive
to a virtuous life, the belief
that &#383;he is an accountable creature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[p 171]</a></span>
and the reflection that &#383;he has an immortal
&#383;oul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicero</span> &#383;poke it as the highe&#383;t commendation
of Cato's character, that
he embraced philo&#383;ophy, not for the
&#383;ake of <i>di&#383;puting</i> like a philo&#383;opher,
but of <i>living</i> like one. The chief purpo&#383;e
of chri&#383;tian knowledge is to promote
the great end of a chri&#383;tian life.
Every rational woman &#383;hould, no
doubt, be able to give a rea&#383;on of
the hope that is in her; but this knowledge
is be&#383;t acquired, and the duties
con&#383;equent on it be&#383;t performed, by
reading books of plain piety and practical
devotion, and not by entering
into the endle&#383;s feuds, and engaging
in the unprofitable contentions of partial
controver&#383;iali&#383;ts. Nothing is more
unamiable than the narrow &#383;pirit of
party zeal, nor more di&#383;gu&#383;ting than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[p 172]</a></span>
to hear a woman deal out judgments,
and denounce vengeance again&#383;t any
one, who happens to differ from her
in &#383;ome opinion, perhaps of no real
importance, and which, it is probable,
&#383;he may be ju&#383;t as wrong in rejecting,
as the object of her cen&#383;ure is
in embracing. A furious and unmerciful
female bigot wanders as far beyond
the limits pre&#383;cribed to her &#383;ex,
as a Thale&#383;tris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent
debate has made as few converts
as the &#383;word, and both the&#383;e in&#383;truments
are particularly unbecoming
when wielded by a female hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, though no one will be frightened
out of their opinions, yet they
may be per&#383;uaded out of them: they
may be touched by the affecting earne&#383;tne&#383;s
of &#383;erious conver&#383;ation, and
allured by the attractive beauty of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[p 173]</a></span>
con&#383;i&#383;tently &#383;erious life. And while
a young woman ought to dread the
name of a wrangling polemic, it is her
duty to a&#383;pire after the honourable
character of a &#383;incere Chri&#383;tian. But
this dignified character &#383;he can by no
means de&#383;erve, if &#383;he is ever afraid to
avow her principles, or a&#383;hamed to
defend them. A profligate, who makes
it a point to ridicule every thing which
comes under the appearance of formal
in&#383;truction, will be di&#383;concerted at the
&#383;pirited yet mode&#383;t rebuke of a pious
young woman. But there is as much
efficacy in the manner of reproving
prophanene&#383;s, as in the words. If &#383;he
corrects it with moro&#383;ene&#383;s, &#383;he defeats
the effect of her remedy, by her un&#383;kilful
manner of admini&#383;tring it. If,
on the other hand, &#383;he affects to defend
the in&#383;ulted cau&#383;e of God, in a
faint tone of voice, and &#383;tudied ambi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[p 174]</a></span>guity
of phra&#383;e, or with an air of levity,
and a certain expre&#383;&#383;ion of plea&#383;ure
in her eyes, which proves &#383;he is
&#383;ecretly delighted with what &#383;he pretends
to cen&#383;ure, &#383;he injures religion
much more than he did who publickly
prophaned it; for &#383;he plainly indicates,
either that &#383;he does not believe, or
re&#383;pect what &#383;he profe&#383;&#383;es. The other
attacked it as an open foe; &#383;he betrays
it as a fal&#383;e friend. No one pays any
regard to the opinion of an avowed
enemy; but the de&#383;ertion or treachery
of a profe&#383;&#383;ed friend, is dangerous indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a &#383;trange notion which prevails
in the world, that religion only belongs
to the old and the melancholy,
and that it is not worth while to pay
the lea&#383;t attention to it, while we are
capable of attending to any thing el&#383;e.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[p 175]</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> <i>&#383;en&#383;e</i> is as different from

yet, though di&#383;tinct qualities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[p 179]</a></span>
they frequently &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t together. It
is altogether oppo&#383;ite to <i>wit</i>, but by
no means incon&#383;i&#383;tent with it. It is
not &#383;cience, for there is &#383;uch a thing
as unlettered good &#383;en&#383;e; yet, though
it is neither wit, learning, nor genius,
it is a &#383;ub&#383;titute for each, where they
do not exi&#383;t, and the perfection of all
where they do.</p>

<p>Good &#383;en&#383;e is &#383;o far from de&#383;erving
the appellation of <i>common &#383;en&#383;e</i>, by
which it is frequently called, that it is
perhaps one of the rare&#383;t qualities of
the human mind. If, indeed, this
name is given it in re&#383;pect to its peculiar
&#383;uitablene&#383;s to the purpo&#383;es of
common life, there is great propriety<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[p 180]</a></span>
in it. Good &#383;en&#383;e appears to differ
from ta&#383;te in this, that ta&#383;te is an in&#383;tantaneous
deci&#383;ion of the mind, a
&#383;udden reli&#383;h of what is beautiful, or
di&#383;gu&#383;t at what is defective, in an object,
without waiting for the &#383;lower
confirmation of the judgment. Good
&#383;en&#383;e is perhaps that confirmation,
which e&#383;tabli&#383;hes a &#383;uddenly conceived
idea, or feeling, by the powers of
comparing and reflecting. They differ
al&#383;o in this, that ta&#383;te &#383;eems to have
a more immediate reference to arts,
to literature, and to almo&#383;t every object
of the &#383;en&#383;es; while good &#383;en&#383;e
ri&#383;es to moral excellence, and exerts
its influence on life and manners. Ta&#383;te
is fitted to the perception and enjoyment
of whatever is beautiful in art
or nature: Good &#383;en&#383;e, to the improvement
of the conduct, and the regulation
of the heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[p 181]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> the term good &#383;en&#383;e, is u&#383;ed indi&#383;criminately
to expre&#383;s either a fini&#383;hed
ta&#383;te for letters, or an invariable
prudence in the affairs of life. It is
&#383;ometimes applied to the mo&#383;t moderate
abilities, in which ca&#383;e, the expre&#383;&#383;ion
is certainly too &#383;trong; and at
others to the mo&#383;t &#383;hining, when it is
as much too weak and inadequate. A
&#383;en&#383;ible man is the u&#383;ual, but unappropriated
phra&#383;e, for every degree in the
&#383;cale of under&#383;tanding, from the &#383;ober
mortal, who obtains it by his decent
demeanor and &#383;olid dullne&#383;s, to him
who&#383;e talents qualify him to rank with
a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genius</span> is the power of invention
and imitation. It is an incommunicable

of it on another: no pains or la<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[p 182]</a></span>bour
can reach the &#383;ummit of perfection,
where the &#383;eeds of it are wanting
in the mind; yet it is capable of
infinite improvement where it actually
exi&#383;ts, and is attended with the highe&#383;t
capacity of communicating in&#383;truction,
as well as delight to others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the peculiar property of genius
to &#383;trike out great or beautiful things:
it is the felicity of good &#383;en&#383;e not to do
ab&#383;urd ones. Genius breaks out in
&#383;plendid &#383;entiments and elevated ideas;
good &#383;en&#383;e confines its more circum&#383;cribed,

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> &#383;uperficial judges, who, it
mu&#383;t be confe&#383;&#383;ed, make up the greater
part of the ma&#383;s of mankind, talents

to be in a &#383;omewhat higher &#383;tate of

a &#383;uperiority, but of its
extent they neither know the value,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[p 184]</a></span>
nor can conceive the reality. It is
true, the mind, as well as the eye,
can take in objects larger than it&#383;elf;
but this is only true of great minds:
for a man of low capacity, who con&#383;iders
a con&#383;ummate genius, re&#383;embles
one, who &#383;eeing a column for the fir&#383;t

to take in the whole of it, concludes
it to be flat. Or, like one

can form no idea of the &#383;pherical form

believe, that, next to principle, it is
owing to their <i>good &#383;en&#383;e</i>, which regulates
and cha&#383;ti&#383;es their imaginations.
The va&#383;t conceptions which enable a

line of regularity; till good &#383;en&#383;e, acting

<p><span class="smcap">Add</span> to this, when it is con&#383;idered
with what imperfection the Divine
Wi&#383;dom has thought fit to &#383;tamp every

excellence and infirmity are &#383;o in&#383;eparably
wound up in each other, that a
man derives the &#383;orene&#383;s of temper,
and irritability of nerve, which make
him unea&#383;y to others, and unhappy in
him&#383;elf, from tho&#383;e exqui&#383;ite feelings,
and that elevated pitch of thought, by
which, as the apo&#383;tle expre&#383;&#383;es it on a

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span>, might not Providence intend
to humble human pride, by pre&#383;enting
to our eyes &#383;o mortifying a view of the
weakne&#383;s and infirmity of even his be&#383;t

wi&#383;ely tempered human excellence with
a certain con&#383;ciou&#383;ne&#383;s of its own imperfection.
But though this inevitable
alloy of weakne&#383;s may frequently be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[p 191]</a></span>
found in the be&#383;t characters, yet how
can that be the &#383;ource of triumph and
exaltation to any, which, if properly
weighed, mu&#383;t be the deepe&#383;t motive

man will be &#383;o far from rejoicing, that
he will be &#383;ecretly troubled, whenever he

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is remarked by Pope, in his E&#383;&#383;ay

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten cen&#383;ure wrong for one who writes ami&#383;s.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I apprehend it does not therefore
follow that to judge, is more difficult
than to write. If this were the ca&#383;e,
the critic would be &#383;uperior to the
poet, whereas it appears to be directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[p 192]</a></span>
the contrary. "The critic, (&#383;ays the
great champion of Shake&#383;peare,) but
fa&#383;hions the body of a work, the poet
mu&#383;t add the &#383;oul, which gives force
and direction to its actions and ge&#383;tures."
It &#383;hould &#383;eem that the rea&#383;on why &#383;o
many more judge wrong, than write
ill, is becau&#383;e the number of readers
is beyond all proportion greater than
the number of writers. Every man
who reads, is in &#383;ome mea&#383;ure a critic,
and, with very common abilities, may
point out real faults and material errors
in a very well written book; but
it by no means follows that he is able
to write any thing comparable to the
work which he is capable of cen&#383;uring.
And unle&#383;s the numbers of tho&#383;e who
write, and of tho&#383;e who judge, were
more equal, the calculation &#383;eems not
to be quite fair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[p 193]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A capacity</span> for reli&#383;hing works of

ability to enjoy the compo&#383;itions of
others, entitle a man to the claim of
reputation, it is &#383;till a far inferior degree
of merit to his who can invent and
produce tho&#383;e compo&#383;itions, the bare

an opinion that will weaken the energy
and reduce the powers of the mind,
which, though once perhaps vigorous
and effectual, will be &#383;unk to a &#383;tate
of literary imbecility, by cheri&#383;hing
vain and pre&#383;umptuous ideas of its
own independence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> in&#383;tance, it may not be nece&#383;&#383;ary
that a poet &#383;hould be deeply &#383;killed in
the Linn&aelig;an &#383;y&#383;tem; but it mu&#383;t be
allowed that a general acquaintance
with plants and flowers will furni&#383;h<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[p 196]</a></span>
him with a delightful and profitable &#383;pecies
of in&#383;truction. He is not obliged to
trace Nature in all her nice and varied
operations, with the minute accuracy
of a Boyle, or the laborious inve&#383;tigation
of a Newton; but his <i>good &#383;en&#383;e</i>
will point out to him that no incon&#383;iderable
portion of philo&#383;ophical knowledge
is requi&#383;ite to the completion of
his literary character. The &#383;ciences
are more independent, and require
little or no a&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance from the graces
of poetry; but poetry, if &#383;he would
charm and in&#383;truct, mu&#383;t not be &#383;o
haughty; &#383;he mu&#383;t be contented to
borrow of the &#383;ciences, many of her
choice&#383;t allu&#383;ions, and many of her
mo&#383;t graceful embelli&#383;hments; and does
it not magnify the character of true
poe&#383;y, that &#383;he includes within her&#383;elf
all the &#383;cattered graces of every &#383;eparate
art?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[p 197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rules of the great ma&#383;ters in
critici&#383;m may not be &#383;o nece&#383;&#383;ary to
the forming a good ta&#383;te, as the examination
of tho&#383;e original mines
from whence they drew their trea&#383;ures
of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three celebrated E&#383;&#383;ays on the
Art of Poetry do not teach &#383;o much
by their laws as by their examples;
the dead letter of their rules is le&#383;s in&#383;tructive
than the living &#383;pirit of their
ver&#383;e. Yet the&#383;e rules are to a young
poet, what the &#383;tudy of logarithms is
to a young mathematician; they do
not &#383;o much contribute to form his
judgment, as afford him the &#383;ati&#383;faction
of convincing him that he is right.
They do not preclude the difficulty of
the operation; but at the conclu&#383;ion of
it, furni&#383;h him with a fuller demon&#383;tration
that he has proceeded on pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[p 198]</a></span>per
principles. When he has well
&#383;tudied the ma&#383;ters in who&#383;e &#383;chools
the fir&#383;t critics formed them&#383;elves, and
fancies he has caught a &#383;park of their
divine Flame, it may be a good method
to try his own compo&#383;itions by
the te&#383;t of the critic rules, &#383;o far indeed
as the mechani&#383;m of poetry goes.
If the examination be fair and candid,
this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's
&#383;pear, will detect every latent error, and
bring to light every favourite failing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> ta&#383;te always &#383;uits the mea&#383;ure
of its admiration to the merit of the
compo&#383;ition it examines. It accommodates
its prai&#383;es, or its cen&#383;ure, to
the excellence of a work, and appropriates
it to the nature of it. General
applau&#383;e, or indi&#383;criminate abu&#383;e, is
the &#383;ign of a vulgar under&#383;tanding.
There are certain blemi&#383;hes which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[p 199]</a></span>
judicious and good-natured reader will
candidly overlook. But the fal&#383;e &#383;ublime,
the tumour which is intended
for greatne&#383;s, the di&#383;torted figure, the
puerile conceit, and the incongruous
metaphor, the&#383;e are defects for which
&#383;carcely any other kind of merit can
atone. And yet there may be more
hope of a writer (e&#383;pecially if he be a
a young one), who is now and then
guilty of &#383;ome of the&#383;e faults, than of
one who avoids them all, not through
judgment, but feeblene&#383;s, and who,
in&#383;tead of deviating into error is continually
falling &#383;hort of excellence.
The meer ab&#383;ence of error implies that
moderate and inferior degree of merit
with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic
ta&#383;te will be better &#383;ati&#383;fied than
with the magnificent irregularities of
exalted &#383;pirits. It &#383;tretches &#383;ome minds
to an unea&#383;y exten&#383;ion to be obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[p 200]</a></span>
to attend to compo&#383;itions &#383;uperlatively
excellent; and it contracts liberal &#383;ouls
to a painful narrowne&#383;s to de&#383;cend to
books of inferior merit. A work of
capital genius, to a man of an ordinary
mind, is the bed of Procru&#383;tes to one
of a &#383;hort &#383;tature, the man is too little
to fill up the &#383;pace a&#383;&#383;igned him, and
undergoes the torture in attempting
it: and a moderate, or low production
to a man of bright talents, is the puni&#383;hment
inflicted by Mezentius; the
living &#383;pirit has too much animation to
endure patiently to be in contact with
a dead body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taste</span> se&#383;ms to be a &#383;entiment of
the &#383;oul which gives the bias to opinion,
for we feel before we reflect. Without
this &#383;entiment, all knowledge, learning
and opinion, would be cold, inert
materials, whereas they become active<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[p 201]</a></span>
principles when &#383;tirred, kindled, and
inflamed by this animating quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another feeling which is
called Enthu&#383;ia&#383;m. The enthu&#383;ia&#383;m
of &#383;en&#383;ible hearts is &#383;o &#383;trong, that it
not only yields to the impul&#383;e with
which &#383;triking objects act on it, but
&#383;uch hearts help on the effect by their
own &#383;en&#383;ibility. In a &#383;cene where
Shake&#383;peare and Garrick give perfection
to each other, the feeling heart
does not merely accede to the delirium
they occa&#383;ion: it does more, it is enamoured
of it, it &#383;olicits the delu&#383;ion,
it &#383;ues to be deceived, and grudgingly
cheri&#383;hes the &#383;acred trea&#383;ure of its feelings.

they meet not with any ob&#383;truction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[p 202]</a></span>
from the coldne&#383;s of our own feelings.
Perhaps, only a few fine &#383;pirits can
enter into the detail of their writing
and acting; but the multitude do not
enjoy le&#383;s acutely, becau&#383;e they are
not able philo&#383;ophically to analy&#383;e the
&#383;ources of their joy or &#383;orrow. If the
others have the advantage of judging,
the&#383;e have at lea&#383;t the privilege of
feeling: and it is not from complai&#383;ance
to a few leading judges, that they
bur&#383;t into peals of laughter, or melt
into delightful agony; their hearts decide,
and that is a deci&#383;ion from which
there lies no appeal. It mu&#383;t however
be confe&#383;&#383;ed, that the nicer &#383;eparations
of character, and the lighter
and almo&#383;t imperceptible &#383;hades which
&#383;ometimes di&#383;tingui&#383;h them, will not
be intimately reli&#383;hed, unle&#383;s there be
a con&#383;onancy of ta&#383;te as well as feeling
in the &#383;pectator; though where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[p 203]</a></span>
pa&#383;&#383;ions are principally concerned, the
profane vulgar come in for a larger
portion of the univer&#383;al delight, than
critics and connoi&#383;&#383;eurs are willing to
allow them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> enthu&#383;ia&#383;m, though the natural
concomitant of genius, is no more
genius it&#383;elf, than drunkenne&#383;s is cheerfulne&#383;s;
and that enthu&#383;ia&#383;m which
di&#383;covers it&#383;elf on occa&#383;ions not worthy
to excite it, is the mark of a wretched
judgment and a fal&#383;e ta&#383;te.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span> produces innumerable objects:
to imitate them, is the province
of Genius; to direct tho&#383;e imitations,
is the property of Judgment; to decide
on their effects, is the bu&#383;ine&#383;s of Ta&#383;te.
For Ta&#383;te, who &#383;its as &#383;upreme judge
on the productions of Genius, is not
&#383;ati&#383;fied when &#383;he merely imitates Na<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[p 204]</a></span>ture:
&#383;he mu&#383;t al&#383;o, &#383;ays an ingenious
French writer, imitate <i>beautiful</i>
Nature. It requires no le&#383;s judgment
to reject than to choo&#383;e, and Genius
might imitate what is vulgar, under
pretence that it was natural, if Ta&#383;te
did not carefully point out tho&#383;e objects
which are mo&#383;t proper for imitation.
It al&#383;o requires a very nice di&#383;cernment
to di&#383;tingui&#383;h veri&#383;imilitude
from truth; for there is a truth in
Ta&#383;te nearly as conclu&#383;ive as demon&#383;tration
in mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genius</span>, when in the full impetuo&#383;ity
of its career, often touches on the
very brink of error; and is, perhaps,
never &#383;o near the verge of the precipice,
as when indulging its &#383;ublime&#383;t
flights. It is in tho&#383;e great, but dangerous
moments, that the curb of
vigilant judgment is mo&#383;t wanting:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[p 205]</a></span>
while &#383;afe and &#383;ober Dulne&#383;s ob&#383;erves
one tedious and in&#383;ipid round of tire&#383;ome
uniformity, and &#383;teers equally
clear of eccentricity and of beauty.
Dulne&#383;s has few redundancies to retrench,
few luxuriancies to prune, and
few irregularities to &#383;mooth. The&#383;e,
though errors, are the errors of Genius,
for there is rarely redundancy
without plenitude, or irregularity without
greatne&#383;s. The exce&#383;&#383;es of Genius
may ea&#383;ily be retrenched, but the deficiencies
of Dulne&#383;s can never be &#383;upplied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who copy from others will
doubtle&#383;s be le&#383;s excellent than tho&#383;e
who copy from Nature. To imitate
imitators, is the way to depart too far
from the great original her&#383;elf. The
latter copies of an engraving retain
fainter and fainter traces of the &#383;ub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[p 206]</a></span>ject,
to which the earlier impre&#383;&#383;ions
bore &#383;o &#383;trong a re&#383;emblance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> &#383;eems very extraordinary, that it
&#383;hould be the mo&#383;t difficult thing in
the world to be natural, and that it
&#383;hould be harder to hit off the manners
of real life, and to delineate &#383;uch characters
as we conver&#383;e with every day,
than to imagine &#383;uch as do not exi&#383;t.
But caricature is much ea&#383;ier than an
exact outline, and the colouring of
fancy le&#383;s difficult than that of truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> do not always know what ta&#383;te
they have, till it is awakened by &#383;ome
corre&#383;ponding object; nay, genius it&#383;elf
is a fire, which in many minds
would never blaze, if not kindled by
&#383;ome external cau&#383;e.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span>, that munificent mother,
when &#383;he be&#383;tows the power of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[p 207]</a></span>ing,
accompanies it with the capacity
of enjoying. The judgment, which
is clear &#383;ighted, points out &#383;uch objects
as are calculated to in&#383;pire love, and
the heart in&#383;tantaneou&#383;ly attaches it&#383;elf
to whatever is lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> regard to literary reputation, a
great deal depends on the &#383;tate of
learning in the particular age or nation,
in which an author lives. In a
dark and ignorant period, moderate
knowledge will entitle its po&#383;&#383;e&#383;&#383;or to
a con&#383;iderable &#383;hare of fame; whereas,
to be di&#383;tingui&#383;hed in a polite and lettered
age, requires &#383;triking parts and
deep erudition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a nation begins to emerge
from a &#383;tate of mental darkne&#383;s, and to
&#383;trike out the fir&#383;t rudiments of improvement,
it chalks out a few &#383;trong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[p 208]</a></span>
but incorrect &#383;ketches, gives the rude
out-lines of general art, and leaves the
filling up to the lei&#383;ure of happier
days, and the refinement of more enlightened
times. Their drawing is a
rude <i>Sbozzo</i>, and their poetry wild
min&#383;trel&#383;y.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perfection</span> of ta&#383;te is a point which
a nation no &#383;ooner reaches, than it
over&#383;hoots; and it is more difficult to
return to it, after having pa&#383;&#383;ed it,
than it was to attain when they fell
&#383;hort of it. Where the arts begin to
langui&#383;h after having flouri&#383;hed, they
&#383;eldom indeed fall back to their original
barbari&#383;m, but a certain feeblene&#383;s
of exertion takes place, and it is more
difficult to recover them from this
dying languor to their proper &#383;trength,
than it was to poli&#383;h them from their
former rudene&#383;s; for it is a le&#383;s for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[p 209]</a></span>midable
undertaking to refine barbarity,
than to &#383;top decay: the fir&#383;t may
be laboured into elegance, but the
latter will rarely be &#383;trengthened into
vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taste</span> exerts it&#383;elf at fir&#383;t but feebly
and imperfectly: it is repre&#383;&#383;ed and kept
back by a crowd of the mo&#383;t di&#383;couraging
prejudices: like an infant
prince, who, though born to reign,
yet holds an idle &#383;ceptre, which he has
not power to u&#383;e, but is obliged to &#383;ee
with the eyes, and hear through the
ears of other men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> of correct ta&#383;te will hardly
ever go out of his way, even in
&#383;earch of embelli&#383;hment: he will &#383;tudy
to attain the be&#383;t end by the mo&#383;t natural
means; for he knows that what
is not natural cannot be beautiful, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[p 210]</a></span>
that nothing can be beautiful out of
its own place; for an improper &#383;ituation
will convert the mo&#383;t &#383;triking
beauty into a glaring defect. When
by a well-connected chain of ideas,
or a judicious &#383;ucce&#383;&#383;ion of events, the
reader is &#383;natched to "Thebes or
Athens," what can be more impertinent
than for the poet to ob&#383;truct the
operation of the pa&#383;&#383;ion he has ju&#383;t
been kindling, by introducing a conceit
which contradicts his purpo&#383;e,
and interrupts his bu&#383;ine&#383;s? Indeed,
we cannot be tran&#383;ported, even in
idea, to tho&#383;e places, if the poet does
not manage &#383;o adroitly as not to make
us &#383;en&#383;ible of the journey: the in&#383;tant
we feel we are travelling, the writer's
art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proserpine</span>, &#383;ays Ovid, would have

not A&#383;calaphus &#383;een her &#383;top to gather
a golden apple, when the terms of her
re&#383;toration were, that &#383;he &#383;hould ta&#383;te
nothing. A &#383;tory pregnant with in&#383;truction
for lively writers, who by
neglecting the main bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and going
out of the way for fal&#383;e gratifications,
lo&#383;e &#383;ight of the end they &#383;hould
principally keep in view. It was this
fal&#383;e ta&#383;te that introduced the numberle&#383;s
<i>concetti</i>, which di&#383;grace the brighte&#383;t
of the Italian poets; and this is the
rea&#383;on, why the reader only feels &#383;hort
and interrupted &#383;natches of delight in
peru&#383;ing the brilliant but unequal
compo&#383;itions of Ario&#383;to, in&#383;tead of
that unbroken and undimini&#383;hed plea&#383;ure,
which he con&#383;tantly receives from
Virgil, from Milton, and generally
from Ta&#383;&#383;o. The fir&#383;t-mentioned Italian
is the Atalanta, who will interrupt
the mo&#383;t eager career, to pick up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[p 212]</a></span>
glittering mi&#383;chief, while the Mantuan
and the Briti&#383;h bards, like Hippomenes,
pre&#383;s on warm in the pur&#383;uit,
and un&#383;educed by temptation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> of real ta&#383;te will take
great pains in the perfection of his &#383;tyle,
to make the reader believe that he took
none at all. The writing which appears
to be mo&#383;t ea&#383;y, will be generally
found to be lea&#383;t imitable. The
mo&#383;t elegant ver&#383;es are the mo&#383;t ea&#383;ily
retained, they fa&#383;ten them&#383;elves on the
memory, without its making any effort
to pre&#383;erve them, and we are apt to imagine,
that what is remembered with
ea&#383;e, was written without difficulty.</p>

<p>To conclude; Genius is a rare and
precious gem, of which few know
the worth; it is fitter for the cabinet
of the connoi&#383;&#383;eur, than for the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[p 213]</a></span>merce
of mankind. Good &#383;en&#383;e is a
bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable
at all times, and current in
all places. It knows the value of
&#383;mall things, and con&#383;iders that an
aggregate of them makes up the &#383;um
of human affairs. It elevates common
concerns into matters of importance,
by performing them in the be&#383;t manner,
and at the mo&#383;t &#383;uitable &#383;ea&#383;on.
Good &#383;en&#383;e carries with it the idea of
equality, while Genius is always &#383;u&#383;pected
of a de&#383;ign to impo&#383;e the burden
of &#383;uperiority; and re&#383;pect is paid to
it with that reluctance which always
attends other impo&#383;ts, the lower orders
of mankind generally repining
mo&#383;t at demands, by which they are
lea&#383;t liable to be affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it is the character of Genius to
penetrate with a lynx's beam into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[p 214]</a></span>
unfathomable aby&#383;&#383;es and uncreated
worlds, and to &#383;ee what is <i>not</i>, &#383;o it
is the property of good &#383;en&#383;e to di&#383;tingui&#383;h
perfectly, and judge accurately
what really <i>is</i>. Good &#383;en&#383;e has not &#383;o

but as far as it <i>does</i> &#383;ee, it di&#383;cerns
di&#383;tinctly. Good &#383;en&#383;e is a judicious
mechanic, who can produce beauty
and convenience out of &#383;uitable means;
but Genius (I &#383;peak with reverence of
the immea&#383;urable di&#383;tance) bears &#383;ome
remote re&#383;emblance to the divine architect,
who produced perfection of
beauty without any vi&#383;ible materials,

<h2><a name="sINTRODUCTION" id="sINTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with the utmost diffidence
that the following pages are submitted
to the inspection of the
Public: yet, however the limited abilities
of the author may have prevented
her from succeeding to her wish in the
execution of her present attempt, she
humbly trusts that the uprightness of
her intention will procure it a candid
and favourable reception. The following
little Essays are chiefly calculated
for the younger part of her own<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_2" id="sPage_2">[p 2]</a></span>
sex, who, she flatters herself, will not
esteem them the less, because they were
written immediately for their service.
She by no means pretends to have
composed a regular system of morals,
or a finished plan of conduct: she has
only endeavoured to make a few remarks
on such circumstances as seemed
to her susceptible of some improvement,
and on such subjects as she imagined
were particularly interesting to
young ladies, on their first introduction
into the world. She hopes they
will not be offended if she has occasionally
pointed out certain qualities,
and suggested certain tempers, and
dispositions, as <i>peculiarly feminine</i>, and
hazarded some observations which naturally
arose from the subject, on the
different characters which mark the
sexes. And here again she takes the
liberty to repeat that these distinctions<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_3" id="sPage_3">[p 3]</a></span>
cannot be too nicely maintained; for
besides those important qualities common
to both, each sex has its respective,
appropriated qualifications, which
would cease to be meritorious, the instant
they ceased to be appropriated.
Nature, propriety, and custom have
prescribed certain bounds to each;
bounds which the prudent and the
candid will never attempt to break
down; and indeed it would be highly
impolitic to annihilate distinctions from
which each acquires excellence, and
to attempt innovations, by which both
would be losers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> therefore never understand
their own interests so little, as when
they affect those qualities and accomplishments,
from the want of which
they derive their highest merit. "The
<i>porcelain</i> clay of human kind," says<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_4" id="sPage_4">[p 4]</a></span>
an admired writer, speaking of the sex.
Greater delicacy evidently implies
greater fragility; and this weakness, natural
and moral, clearly points out the
necessity of a superior degree of caution,
retirement, and reserve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> the author may be allowed to
keep up the allusion of the poet, just
quoted, she would ask if we do not
put the finest vases, and the costliest
images in places of the greatest security,
and most remote from any probability
of accident, or destruction?
By being so situated, they find their
protection in their weakness, and their
safety in their delicacy. This metaphor
is far from being used with a design
of placing young ladies in a trivial,
unimportant light; it is only
introduced to insinuate, that where
there is more beauty, and more weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_5" id="sPage_5">[p 5]</a></span>ness,
there should be greater circumspection,
and superior prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Men</span>, on the contrary, are formed
for the more public exhibitions on the
great theatre of human life. Like the
stronger and more substantial wares,
they derive no injury, and lose no
polish by being always exposed, and
engaged in the constant commerce of
the world. It is their proper element,
where they respire their natural air,
and exert their noblest powers, in
situations which call them into action.
They were intended by Providence for
the bustling scenes of life; to appear
terrible in arms, useful in commerce,
shining in counsels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Author fears it will be hazarding
a very bold remark, in the opinion
of many ladies, when she adds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_6" id="sPage_6">[p 6]</a></span>
that the female mind, in general, does
not appear capable of attaining so
high a degree of perfection in science
as the male. Yet she hopes to be forgiven
when she observes also, that as
it does not seem to derive the chief
portion of its excellence from extraordinary
abilities of this kind, it is
not at all lessened by the imputation of
not possessing them. It is readily allowed,
that the sex have lively imaginations,
and those exquisite perceptions
of the beautiful and defective,
which come under the denomination of
Taste. But pretensions to that strength
of intellect, which is requisite to penetrate
into the abstruser walks of literature,
it is presumed they will readily
relinquish. There are green pastures,
and pleasant vallies, where they
may wander with safety to themselves,
and delight to others. They may cul<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_7" id="sPage_7">[p 7]</a></span>tivate
the roses of imagination, and the
valuable fruits of morals and criticism;
but the steeps of Parnassus few,
comparatively, have attempted to scale
with success. And when it is considered,
that many languages, and many
sciences, must contribute to the perfection
of poetical composition, it will
appear less strange. The lofty Epic,
the pointed Satire, and the more daring
and successful flights of the Tragic
Muse, seem reserved for the bold adventurers
of the other sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nor</span> does this assertion, it is apprehended,
at all injure the interests of
the women; they have other pretensions,
on which to value themselves,
and other qualities much better calculated
to answer their particular purposes.
We are enamoured of the soft
strains of the Sicilian and the Mantuan<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_8" id="sPage_8">[p 8]</a></span>
Muse, while, to the sweet notes of the
pastoral reed, they sing the Contentions
of the Shepherds, the Blessings of
Love, or the innocent Delights of rural
Life. Has it ever been ascribed to
them as a defect, that their Eclogues
do not treat of active scenes, of busy
cities, and of wasting war? No:
their simplicity is their perfection, and
they are only blamed when they have
too little of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other hand, the lofty bards
who strung their bolder harps to higher
measures, and sung the <i>Wrath</i> of <i>Peleus'
Son</i>, and <i>Man's first Disobedience</i>,
have never been censured for want
of sweetness and refinement. The sublime,
the nervous, and the masculine,
characterise their compositions; as the
beautiful, the soft, and the delicate,
mark those of the others. Grandeur,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_9" id="sPage_9">[p 9]</a></span>
dignity, and force, distinguish the one
species; ease, simplicity, and purity,
the other. Both shine from their native,
distinct, unborrowed merits, not
from those which are foreign, adventitious,
and unnatural. Yet those excellencies,
which make up the essential
and constituent parts of poetry, they
have in common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Women</span> have generally quicker perceptions;
men have juster sentiments.&mdash;Women
consider how things may
be prettily said; men how they may
be properly said.&mdash;In women, (young
ones at least) speaking accompanies,
and sometimes precedes reflection; in
men, reflection is the antecedent.&mdash;Women
speak to shine or to please;
men, to convince or confute.&mdash;Women
admire what is brilliant; men
what is solid.&mdash;Women prefer an ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_10" id="sPage_10">[p 10]</a></span>temporaneous
sally of wit, or a sparkling
effusion of fancy, before the most
accurate reasoning, or the most laborious
investigation of facts. In literary
composition, women are pleased
with point, turn, and antithesis; men
with observation, and a just deduction
of effects from their causes.&mdash;Women
are fond of incident, men of
argument.&mdash;Women admire passionately,
men approve cautiously.&mdash;One sex
will think it betrays a want of feeling
to be moderate in their applause,
the other will be afraid of exposing a
want of judgment by being in raptures
with any thing.&mdash;Men refuse to
give way to the emotions they actually
feel, while women sometimes affect
to be transported beyond what
the occasion will justify.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_11" id="sPage_11">[p 11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a farther confirmation of what
has been advanced on the different
bent of the understanding in the
sexes, it may be observed, that we
have heard of many female wits, but
never of one female logician&mdash;of many
admirable writers of memoirs, but never
of one chronologer.&mdash;In the boundless
and a&euml;rial regions of romance, and
in that fashionable species of composition
which succeeded it, and which
carries a nearer approximation to the
manners of the world, the women
cannot be excelled: this imaginary
soil they have a peculiar talent for cultivating,
because here,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Invention labours more, and judgment less.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> merit of this kind of writing
consists in the <i>vraisemblance</i> to real
life as to the events themselves, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_12" id="sPage_12">[p 12]</a></span>
a certain elevation in the narrative,
which places them, if not above what
is natural, yet above what is common.
It farther consists in the art of interesting
the tender feelings by a pathetic
representation of those minute, endearing,
domestic circumstances, which
take captive the soul before it has
time to shield itself with the armour
of reflection. To amuse, rather than
to instruct, or to instruct indirectly by
short inferences, drawn from a long
concatenation of circumstances, is at
once the business of this sort of composition,
and one of the characteristics
of female genius<a name="sFNanchor_1_1" id="sFNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#sFootnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_13" id="sPage_13">[p 13]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> short, it appears that the mind
in each sex has some natural kind of
bias, which constitutes a distinction of
character, and that the happiness of
both depends, in a great measure, on
the preservation and observance of
this distinction. For where would be
the superior pleasure and satisfaction
resulting from mixed conversation, if
this difference were abolished? If the
qualities of both were invariably and
exactly the same, no benefit or entertainment
would arise from the tedious
and insipid uniformity of such an intercourse;
whereas considerable advantages
are reaped from a select society
of both sexes. The rough angles
and asperities of male manners
are imperceptibly filed, and gradually
worn smooth, by the polishing of female
conversation, and the refining of
female taste; while the ideas of wo<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_14" id="sPage_14">[p 14]</a></span>men
acquire strength and solidity, by
their associating with sensible, intelligent,
and judicious men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the whole, (even if fame be the
object of pursuit) is it not better to
succeed as women, than to fail as men?
To shine, by walking honourably in
the road which nature, custom, and
education seem to have marked out,
rather than to counteract them all, by
moving awkwardly in a path diametrically
opposite? To be good originals,
rather than bad imitators? In a
word, to be excellent women, rather
than indifferent men?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_15" id="sPage_15">[p 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="sFootnote_1_1" id="sFootnote_1_1"></a><a href="#sFNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> <span class="smcap">The</span> author does not apprehend it makes against
her <span class="smcap">general</span> position, that this nation can boast a
female critic, poet, historian, linguist, philosopher,
and moralist, equal to most of the other sex. To these
particular instances others might be adduced; but it
is presumed, that they only stand as exceptions against
the rule, without tending to invalidate the rule itself.

<h2><br /><br />
ON<br />
DISSIPATION.<br />
</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><small>DOGLIE CERTE, ALLEGREZZE INCERTE!</small><br /></span>
<span class="i14"><small>PETRARCA.</small><br /></span>
</div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> an argument in favour of modern
manners, it has been pleaded,
that the softer vices of Luxury
and Dissipation, belong rather to gentle
and yielding tempers, than to
such as are rugged and ferocious: that
they are vices which increase civili<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_16" id="sPage_16">[p 16]</a></span>zation,
and tend to promote refinement,
and the cultivation of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this is an assertion, the truth
of which the experience of all ages
contradicts. Nero was not less a tyrant
for being a fiddler: He<a name="sFNanchor_2_2" id="sFNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#sFootnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who
wished the whole Roman people had
but one neck, that he might dispatch
them at a blow, was himself the most
debauched man in Rome; and Sydney
and Russel were condemned to bleed
under the most barbarous, though most
dissipated and voluptuous, reign that
ever disgraced the annals of Britain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love of dissipation is, I believe,
allowed to be the reigning evil of the
present day. It is an evil which many<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_17" id="sPage_17">[p 17]</a></span>
content themselves with regretting,
without seeking to redress. A dissipated
life is censured in the very act
of dissipation, and prodigality of time
is as gravely declaimed against at the
card table, as in the pulpit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lover of dancing censures the
amusements of the theatre for their
dulness, and the gamester blames them
both for their levity. She, whose whole
soul is swallowed up in "<i>opera extacies</i>"
is astonished, that her acquaintance
can spend whole nights in preying,
like harpies, on the fortunes of
their fellow-creatures; while the grave
sober sinner, who passes her pale and
anxious vigils, in this fashionable sort
of pillaging, is no less surprised how
the other can waste her precious time
in hearing sounds for which she has<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_18" id="sPage_18">[p 18]</a></span>
no taste, in a language she does not
understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> short, every one seems convinced,
that the evil so much complained of
does really exist somewhere, though all
are inwardly persuaded that it is not
with themselves. All desire a general
reformation, but few will listen to proposals
of particular amendment; the
body must be restored, but each limb
begs to remain as it is; and accusations
which concern all, will be likely to affect
none. They think that sin, like
matter, is divisible, and that what is
scattered among so many, cannot materially
affect any one; and thus individuals
contribute separately to that
evil which they in general lament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prevailing manners of an age
depend more than we are aware, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_19" id="sPage_19">[p 19]</a></span>
are willing to allow, on the conduct
of the women; this is one of the principal
hinges on which the great machine
of human society turns. Those
who allow the influence which female
graces have, in contributing to polish
the manners of men, would do well
to reflect how great an influence female
morals must also have on their
conduct. How much then is it to be
regretted, that the British ladies should
ever sit down contented to polish, when
they are able to reform, to entertain,
when they might instruct, and to dazzle
for an hour, when they are candidates
for eternity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> the dispensation of Mahomet's
law, indeed, these mental excellencies
cannot be expected, because
the women are shut out from all opportunities
of instruction, and excluded<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_20" id="sPage_20">[p 20]</a></span>
from the endearing pleasures of a delightful
and equal society; and, as
a charming poet sings, are taught to
believe, that</p>



<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">For their inferior natures<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Form'd to delight, and happy by delighting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heav'n has reserv'd no future paradise,<br /></span>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> act consistently in studying
none but exterior graces, in cultivating
only personal attractions, and in
trying to lighten the intolerable burden
of time, by the most frivolous
and vain amusements. They act in
consequence of their own blind belief,
and the tyranny of their despotic
masters; for they have neither the freedom
of a present choice, nor the prospect
of a future being.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_21" id="sPage_21">[p 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in this land of civil and religious
liberty, where there is as little
despotism exercised over the minds,
as over the persons of women, they
have every liberty of choice, and every
opportunity of improvement; and how
greatly does this increase their obligation
to be exemplary in their general
conduct, attentive to the government
of their families, and instrumental
to the good order of society!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> who is at a loss to find amusements
at home, can no longer apologize
for her dissipation abroad, by
saying she is deprived of the benefit
and the pleasure of books; and she
who regrets being doomed to a state
of dark and gloomy ignorance, by the
injustice, or tyranny of the men, complains
of an evil which does not
exist.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_22" id="sPage_22">[p 22]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a question frequently in the
mouths of illiterate and dissipated females&mdash;"What
good is there in reading?
To what end does it conduce?"
It is, however, too obvious to need insisting
on, that unless perverted, as
the best things may be, reading answers
many excellent purposes beside
the great leading one, and is perhaps
the safest remedy for dissipation. She
who dedicates a portion of her leisure
to useful reading, feels her mind in a
constant progressive state of improvement,
whilst the mind of a dissipated
woman is continually losing ground.
An active spirit rejoiceth, like the sun,
to run his daily course, while indolence,
like the dial of Ahaz, goes
backwards. The advantages which
the understanding receives from polite
literature, it is not here necessary to
enumerate; its effects on the moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_23" id="sPage_23">[p 23]</a></span>
temper is the present object of consideration.
The remark may perhaps be
thought too strong, but I believe it
is true, that next to religious influences,
an habit of study is the most
probable preservative of the virtue of
young persons. Those who cultivate
letters have rarely a strong passion for
promiscuous visiting, or dissipated society;
study therefore induces a relish
for domestic life, the most desirable
temper in the world for women. Study,
as it rescues the mind from an
inordinate fondness for gaming, dress,
and public amusements, is an [oe]conomical
propensity; for a lady may
read at much less expence than she can
play at cards; as it requires some application,
it gives the mind an habit
of industry; as it is a relief against
that mental disease, which the French
emphatically call <i>ennui</i>, it cannot fail<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_24" id="sPage_24">[p 24]</a></span>
of being beneficial to the temper and
spirits, I mean in the moderate degree
in which ladies are supposed to use it;
as an enemy to indolence, it becomes a
social virtue; as it demands the full
exertion of our talents, it grows a rational
duty; and when directed to the
knowledge of the Supreme Being, and
his laws, it rises into an act of religion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rage for reformation commonly
shews itself in a violent zeal for suppressing
what is wrong, rather than in
a prudent attention to establish what is
right; but we shall never obtain a fair
garden merely by rooting up weeds,
we must also plant flowers; for the
natural richness of the soil we have
been clearing will not suffer it to lie
barren, but whether it shall be vainly
or beneficially prolific, depends on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_25" id="sPage_25">[p 25]</a></span>
culture. What the present age has
gained on one side, by a more enlarged
and liberal way of thinking, seems to
be lost on the other, by excessive freedom
and unbounded indulgence. Knowledge
is not, as heretofore, confined
to the dull cloyster, or the gloomy
college, but disseminated, to a certain
degree, among both sexes and
almost all ranks. The only misfortune
is, that these opportunities do
not seem to be so wisely improved, or
turned to so good an account as might
be wished. Books of a pernicious,
idle, and frivolous sort, are too much
multiplied, and it is from the very
redundancy of them that true knowledge
is so scarce, and the habit of
dissipation so much increased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been remarked, that the prevailing
character of the present age is<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_26" id="sPage_26">[p 26]</a></span>
not that of gross immorality: but if
this is meant of those in the higher
walks of life, it is easy to discern,
that there can be but little merit in
abstaining from crimes which there is
but little temptation to commit. It
is however to be feared, that a gradual
defection from piety, will in
time draw after it all the bad consequences
of more active vice; for whether
mounds and fences are suddenly
destroyed by a sweeping torrent, or
worn away through gradual neglect,
the effect is equally destructive. As
a rapid fever and a consuming hectic
are alike fatal to our natural health, so
are flagrant immorality and torpid indolence
to our moral well-being.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> philosophical doctrine of the
slow recession of bodies from the sun,
is a lively image of the reluctance with<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_27" id="sPage_27">[p 27]</a></span>
which we first abandon the light of
virtue. The beginning of folly, and
the first entrance on a dissipated life
cost some pangs to a well-disposed
heart; but it is surprising to see how
soon the progress ceases to be impeded
by reflection, or slackened by remorse.
For it is in moral as in natural things,
the motion in minds as well as bodies
is accelerated by a nearer approach to
the centre to which they are tending.
If we recede slowly at first setting out,
we advance rapidly in our future
course; and to have begun to be
wrong, is already to have made a great
progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A constant</span> habit of amusement
relaxes the tone of the mind, and renders
it totally incapable of application,
study, or virtue. Dissipation not only
indisposes its votaries to every thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_28" id="sPage_28">[p 28]</a></span>
useful and excellent, but disqualifies
them for the enjoyment of pleasure itself.
It softens the soul so much, that
the most superficial employment becomes
a labour, and the slightest inconvenience
an agony. The luxurious
Sybarite must have lost all sense of
real enjoyment, and all relish for true
gratification, before he complained
that he could not sleep, because the
rose leaves lay double under him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Luxury</span> and dissipation, soft and
gentle as their approaches are, and
silently as they throw their silken
chains about the heart, enslave it more
than the most active and turbulent vices.
The mightiest conquerors have been
conquered by these unarmed foes: the
flowery setters are fastened, before they
are felt. The blandishments of Circe
were more fatal to the mariners of<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_29" id="sPage_29">[p 29]</a></span>
Ulysses, than the strength of Polypheme,
or the brutality of the L&aelig;strigons.
Hercules, after he had
cleansed the Augean stable, and performed
all the other labours enjoined
him by Euristheus, found himself a
slave to the softnesses of the heart;
and he, who wore a club and a lion's
skin in the cause of virtue, condescended
to the most effeminate employments
to gratify a criminal weakness.
Hannibal, who vanquished mighty
nations, was himself overcome by the
love of pleasure; and he who despised
cold, and want, and danger, and death
on the Alps, was conquered and undone
by the dissolute indulgences of
Capua.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the hero of the most beautiful
and virtuous romance that ever
was written, I mean Telemachus,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_30" id="sPage_30">[p 30]</a></span>
landed on the island of Cyprus, he unfortunately
lost his prudent companion,
Mentor, in whom wisdom is so
finely personified. At first he beheld
with horror the wanton and dissolute
manners of the voluptuous inhabitants;
the ill effects of their example were
not immediate: he did not fall into
the commission of glaring enormities;
but his virtue was secretly and imperceptibly
undermined, his heart was
softened by their pernicious society;
and the nerve of resolution was slackened:
he every day beheld with diminished
indignation the worship which
was offered to Venus; the disorders of
luxury and prophaneness became less
and less terrible, and the infectious
air of the country enfeebled his courage,
and relaxed his principles. In
short, he had ceased to love virtue
long before he thought of committing<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_31" id="sPage_31">[p 31]</a></span>
actual vice; and the duties of a manly
piety were burdensome to him, before
he was so debased as to offer perfumes,
and burn incense on the altar of the
licentious goddess<a name="sFNanchor_3_3" id="sFNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#sFootnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Let</span> us crown ourselves with rosebuds
before they be withered," said
Solomon's libertine. Alas! he did not
reflect that they withered in the very
gathering. The roses of pleasure seldom
last long enough to adorn the brow<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_32" id="sPage_32">[p 32]</a></span>
of him who plucks them; for they are
the only roses which do not retain their
sweetness after they have lost their
beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> heathen poets often pressed on
their readers the necessity of considering
the shortness of life, as an incentive
to pleasure and voluptuousness;
lest the season for indulging in them
should pass unimproved. The dark
and uncertain notions, not to say the
absolute disbelief, which they entertained
of a future state, is the only
apology that can be offered for this
reasoning. But while we censure their
tenets, let us not adopt their errors;
errors which would be infinitely more
inexcusable in us, who, from the
clearer views which revelation has
given us, shall not have their ignorance
or their doubts to plead. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_33" id="sPage_33">[p 33]</a></span>
were well if we availed ourselves of
that portion of their precept, which
inculcates the improvement of every
moment of our time, but not like them
to dedicate the moments so redeemed
to the pursuit of sensual and perishable
pleasures, but to the securing of those
which are spiritual in their nature, and
eternal in their duration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span>, indeed, like the miserable<a name="sFNanchor_4_4" id="sFNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#sFootnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> beings
imagined by Swift, with a view to
cure us of the irrational desire after
immoderate length of days, we were
condemned to a wretched earthly immortality,
we should have an excuse
for spending some portion of our time
in dissipation, as we might then pretend,
with some colour of reason, that
we proposed, at a distant period, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_34" id="sPage_34">[p 34]</a></span>
enter on a better course of action. Or
if we never formed any such resolution,
it would make no material difference
to beings, whose state was already unalterably
fixed. But of the scanty
portion of days assigned to our lot, not
one should be lost in weak and irresolute
procrastination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have not yet determined
on the side of vanity, who, like Hercules,
(before he knew the queen of
Lydia, and had learnt to spin) have
not resolved on their choice between
<span class="smcap">virtue</span> and <span class="smcap">pleasure</span>, may reflect,
that it is still in their power to imitate
that hero in his noble choice, and in
his virtuous rejection. They may also
reflect with grateful triumph, that
Christianity furnishes them with a better
guide than the tutor of Alcides,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_35" id="sPage_35">[p 35]</a></span>
and with a surer light than the doctrines
of pagan philosophy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is far from my design severely to
condemn the innocent pleasures of life:
I would only beg leave to observe,
that those which are criminal should
never be allowed; and that even the
most innocent will, by immoderate
use, soon cease to be so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> women of this country were
not sent into the world to shun
society, but to embellish it; they
were not designed for wilds and solitudes,
but for the amiable and endearing
offices of social life. They have
useful stations to fill, and important
characters to sustain. They are of a
religion which does not impose penances,
but enjoins duties; a religion
of perfect purity, but of perfect bene<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_36" id="sPage_36">[p 36]</a></span>volence
also. A religion which does
not condemn its followers to indolent
seclusion from the world, but assigns
them the more dangerous, though
more honourable province, of living
uncorrupted in it. In fine, a religion,
which does not direct them to fly from
the multitude, that they may do nothing,
but which positively forbids
them to follow a multitude to do evil.</p>

<h2><br /><br />
THOUGHTS<br />
ON<br />
CONVERSATION.<br />
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been advised, and by very
respectable authorities too, that in
conversation women should carefully
conceal any knowledge or learning
they may happen to possess. I own,
with submission, that I do not see either
the necessity or propriety of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_38" id="sPage_38">[p 38]</a></span>
advice. For if a young lady has that
discretion and modesty, without which
all knowledge is little worth, she will
never make an ostentatious parade of
it, because she will rather be intent on
acquiring more, than on displaying
what she has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I am</span> at a loss to know why a young
female is instructed to exhibit, in the
most advantageous point of view, her
skill in music, her singing, dancing,
taste in dress, and her acquaintance
with the most fashionable games and
amusements, while her piety is to be
anxiously concealed, and her knowledge
affectedly disavowed, lest the former
should draw on her the appellation of
an enthusiast, or the latter that of a
pedant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_39" id="sPage_39">[p 39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> regard to knowledge, why should
she for ever affect to be on her guard,
lest she should be found guilty of a
small portion of it? She need be the
less solicitous about it, as it seldom
proves to be so very considerable as to
excite astonishment or admiration: for,
after all the acquisitions which her
talents and her studies have enabled
her to make, she will, generally speaking,
be found to have less of what is
called <i>learning</i>, than a common school-boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be to the last degree presumptuous
and absurd, for a young
woman to pretend to give the <i>ton</i> to the
company; to interrupt the pleasure of
others, and her own opportunity of
improvement, by talking when she
ought to listen; or to introduce subjects
out of the common road, in or<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_40" id="sPage_40">[p 40]</a></span>der
to shew her own wit, or expose
the want of it in others: but were the
sex to be totally silent when any topic
of literature happens to be discussed in
their presence, conversation would lose
much of its vivacity, and society would
be robbed of one of its most interesting
charms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> easily and effectually may a
well-bred woman promote the most
useful and elegant conversation, almost
without speaking a word! for the modes
of speech are scarcely more variable than
the modes of silence. The silence of
listless ignorance, and the silence of
sparkling intelligence, are perhaps as
separately marked, and as distinctly
expressed, as the same feelings could
have been by the most unequivocal
language. A woman, in a company
where she has the least influence, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_41" id="sPage_41">[p 41]</a></span>
promote any subject by a profound
and invariable attention, which shews
that she is pleased with it, and by an
illuminated countenance, which proves
she understands it. This obliging attention
is the most flattering encouragement
in the world to men of sense and
letters, to continue any topic of instruction
or entertainment they happen
to be engaged in: it owed its introduction
perhaps to accident, the best
introduction in the world for a subject
of ingenuity, which, though it could
not have been formally proposed without
pedantry, may be continued with
ease and good humour; but which
will be frequently and effectually stopped
by the listlessness, inattention, or
whispering of silly girls, whose weariness
betrays their ignorance, and whose
impatience exposes their ill-breeding.
A polite man, however deeply inte<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_42" id="sPage_42">[p 42]</a></span>rested
in the subject on which he is
conversing, catches at the slightest hint
to have done: a look is a sufficient
intimation, and if a pretty simpleton,
who sits near him, seems <i>distraite</i>, he
puts an end to his remarks, to the
great regret of the reasonable part of
the company, who perhaps might have
gained more improvement by the continuance
of such a conversation, than
a week's reading would have yielded
them; for it is such company as this,
that give an edge to each other's wit,
"as iron sharpeneth iron."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> silence is one of the great arts
of conversation is allowed by Cicero
himself, who says, there is not only an
art but even an eloquence in it. And
this opinion is confirmed by a great modern<a name="sFNanchor_5_5" id="sFNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#sFootnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
in the following little anecdote
from one of the ancients.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_43" id="sPage_43">[p 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> many Grecian philosophers
had a solemn meeting before the ambassador
of a foreign prince, each endeavoured
to shew his parts by the
brilliancy of his conversation, that the
ambassador might have something to
relate of the Grecian wisdom. One of
them, offended, no doubt, at the loquacity
of his companions, observed a
profound silence; when the ambassador,
turning to him, asked, "But what
have you to say, that I may report it?"
He made this laconic, but very pointed
reply: "Tell your king, that you have
found one among the Greeks who
knew how to be silent."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a quality infinitely more
intoxicating to the female mind than
knowledge&mdash;this is Wit, the most captivating,
but the most dreaded of all
talents: the most dangerous to those<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_44" id="sPage_44">[p 44]</a></span>
who have it, and the most feared by
those who have it not. Though it is
against all the rules, yet I cannot find
in my heart to abuse this charming
quality. He who is grown rich without
it, in safe and sober dulness, shuns
it as a disease, and looks upon poverty
as its invariable concomitant. The
moralist declaims against it as the
source of irregularity, and the frugal
citizen dreads it more than bankruptcy
itself, for he considers it as the parent
of extravagance and beggary. The
Cynic will ask of what use it is? Of
very little perhaps: no more is a
flower garden, and yet it is allowed as
an object of innocent amusement and
delightful recreation. A woman, who
possesses this quality, has received a
most dangerous present, perhaps not
less so than beauty itself: especially if
it be not sheathed in a temper peculi<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_45" id="sPage_45">[p 45]</a></span>arly
inoffensive, chastised by a most
correct judgment, and restrained by
more prudence than falls to the common
lot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> talent is more likely to make
a woman vain than knowledge; for as
Wit is the immediate property of its
possessor, and learning is only an acquaintance
with the knowledge of other
people, there is much more danger,
that we should be vain of what is our
own, than of what we borrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Wit, like learning, is not near
so common a thing as is imagined.
Let not therefore a young lady be
alarmed at the acuteness of her own
wit, any more than at the abundance
of her own knowledge. The great
danger is, lest she should mistake pertness,
flippancy, or imprudence, for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_46" id="sPage_46">[p 46]</a></span>
brilliant quality, or imagine she is
witty, only because she is indiscreet.
This is very frequently the case, and
this makes the name of wit so cheap,
while its real existence is so rare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lest</span> the flattery of her acquaintance,
or an over-weening opinion of
her own qualifications, should lead
some vain and petulant girl into a false
notion that she has a great deal of wit,
when she has only a redundancy of
animal spirits, she may not find it useless
to attend to the definition of this
quality, by one who had as large a
portion of it, as most individuals could
ever boast:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">'Tis not a tale, 'tis not a jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Admir'd with laughter at a feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor florid talk, which can that title gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The proofs of wit for ever must remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Neither can that have any place,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">At which a virgin hides her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dross the fire must purge away; 'tis just,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The author blush there, where the reader must.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14"><span class="smcap">Cowley</span>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_47" id="sPage_47">[p 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> those who actually possess this
rare talent, cannot be too abstinent in
the use of it. It often makes admirers,
but it never makes friends; I mean,
where it is the predominant feature;
and the unprotected and defenceless
state of womanhood calls for friendship
more than for admiration. She
who does not desire friends has a sordid
and insensible soul; but she who
is ambitious of making every man her
admirer, has an invincible vanity and
a cold heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to dwell only on the side of
policy, a prudent woman, who has
established the reputation of some ge<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_48" id="sPage_48">[p 48]</a></span>nius
will sufficiently maintain it, without
keeping her faculties always on
the stretch to say <i>good things</i>. Nay,
if reputation alone be her object, she
will gain a more solid one by her forbearance,
as the wiser part of her acquaintance
will ascribe it to the right
motive, which is, not that she has less
wit, but that she has more judgment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fatal fondness for indulging a
spirit of ridicule, and the injurious and
irreparable consequences which sometimes
attend the <i>too prompt reply</i>, can
never be too seriously or too severely
condemned. Not to offend, is the first
step towards pleasing. To give pain
is as much an offence against humanity,
as against good breeding; and
surely it is as well to abstain from an
action because it is sinful, as because
it is impolite. In company, young<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_49" id="sPage_49">[p 49]</a></span>
ladies would do well before they speak,
to reflect, if what they are going to
say may not distress some worthy person
present, by wounding them in
their persons, families, connexions, or
religious opinions. If they find it
will touch them in either of these, I
should advise them to suspect, that
what they were going to say is not
so <i>very</i> good a thing as they at first
imagined. Nay, if even it was one of
those bright ideas, which <i>Venus has imbued
with a fifth part of her nectar</i>, so
much greater will be their merit in
suppressing it, if there was a probability
it might offend. Indeed, if they
have the temper and prudence to make
such a previous reflection, they will be
more richly rewarded by their own inward
triumph, at having suppressed
a lively but severe remark, than they
could have been with the dissembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_50" id="sPage_50">[p 50]</a></span>
applauses of the whole company, who,
with that complaisant deceit, which
good breeding too much authorises,
affect openly to admire what they secretly
resolve never to forgive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> always been delighted with
the story of the little girl's eloquence,
in one of the Children's Tales, who received
from a friendly fairy the gift,
that at every word she uttered, pinks,
roses, diamonds, and pearls, should
drop from her mouth. The hidden
moral appears to be this, that it was
the sweetness of her temper which produced
this pretty fanciful effect: for
when her malicious sister desired the
same gift from the good-natured tiny
Intelligence, the venom of her own
heart converted it into poisonous and
loathsome reptiles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_51" id="sPage_51">[p 51]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of sense and breeding will
sometimes join in the laugh, which has
been raised at his expence by an ill-natured
repartee; but if it was very
cutting, and one of those shocking sort
of truths, which as they can scarcely
be pardoned even in private, ought
never to be uttered in public, he does
not laugh because he is pleased, but
because he wishes to conceal how much
he is hurt. As the sarcasm was uttered
by a lady, so far from seeming to resent
it, he will be the first to commend
it; but notwithstanding that, he will
remember it as a trait of malice, when
the whole company shall have forgotten
it as a stroke of wit. Women are
so far from being privileged by their
sex to say unhandsome or cruel things,
that it is this very circumstance which
renders them more intolerable. When
the arrow is lodged in the heart, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_52" id="sPage_52">[p 52]</a></span>
no relief to him who is wounded to
reflect, that the hand which shot it
was a fair one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> women, when they have a
favourite point to gain, or an earnest
wish to bring any one over to their opinion,
often use a very disingenuous
method: they will state a case ambiguously,
and then avail themselves of
it, in whatever manner shall best answer
their purpose; leaving your mind in
a state of indecision as to their real
meaning, while they triumph in the
perplexity they have given you by the
unfair conclusions they draw, from premises
equivocally stated. They will
also frequently argue from exceptions
instead of rules, and are astonished
when you are not willing to be contented
with a prejudice, instead of a
reason.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_53" id="sPage_53">[p 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a sensible company of both sexes,
where women are not restrained by
any other reserve than what their natural
modesty imposes; and where the
intimacy of all parties authorises the
utmost freedom of communication;
should any one inquire what were the
general sentiments on some particular
subject, it will, I believe, commonly
happen, that the ladies, whose imaginations
have kept pace with the narration,
have anticipated its end, and are
ready to deliver their sentiments on it
as soon as it is finished. While some
of the male hearers, whose minds were
busied in settling the propriety, comparing
the circumstances, and examining
the consistencies of what was said,
are obliged to pause and discriminate,
before they think of answering. Nothing
is so embarrassing as a variety of
matter, and the conversation of women<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_54" id="sPage_54">[p 54]</a></span>
is often more perspicuous, because it
is less laboured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> of deep reflection, if he does
not keep up an intimate commerce
with the world, will be sometimes so
entangled in the intricacies of intense
thought, that he will have the appearance
of a confused and perplexed expression;
while a sprightly woman will
extricate herself with that lively and
"rash dexterity," which will almost
always please, though it is very far
from being always right. It is easier
to confound than to convince an opponent;
the former may be effected by
a turn that has more happiness than
truth in it. Many an excellent reasoner,
well skilled in the theory of the
schools, has felt himself discomfited
by a reply, which, though as wide of
the mark, and as foreign to the que<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_55" id="sPage_55">[p 55]</a></span>stion
as can be conceived, has disconcerted
him more than the most startling
proposition, or the most accurate
chain of reasoning could have done;
and he has borne the laugh of his fair
antagonist, as well as of the whole
company, though he could not but
feel, that his own argument was attended
with the fullest demonstration:
so true is it, that it is not always necessary
to be right, in order to be applauded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> let not a young lady's vanity
be too much elated with this false applause,
which is given, not to her
merit, but to her sex: she has not perhaps
gained a victory, though she may
be allowed a triumph; and it should
humble her to reflect, that the tribute
is paid, not to her strength but her
weakness. It is worth while to discri<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_56" id="sPage_56">[p 56]</a></span>minate
between that applause, which
is given from the complaisance of
others, and that which is paid to our
own merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Where</span> great sprightliness is the natural
bent of the temper, girls should
endeavour to habituate themselves to
a custom of observing, thinking, and
reasoning. I do not mean, that they
should devote themselves to abstruse
speculation, or the study of logic; but
she who is accustomed to give a due
arrangement to her thoughts, to reason
justly and pertinently on common
affairs, and judiciously to deduce effects
from their causes, will be a better
logician than some of those who claim
the name, because they have studied
the art: this is being "learned without
the rules;" the best definition,
perhaps, of that sort of literature which<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_57" id="sPage_57">[p 57]</a></span>
is properest for the sex. That species
of knowledge, which appears to be the
result of reflection rather than of science,
sits peculiarly well on women.
It is not uncommon to find a lady,
who, though she does not know a rule
of Syntax, scarcely ever violates one;
and who constructs every sentence she
utters, with more propriety than many
a learned dunce, who has every rule
of Aristotle by heart, and who can
lace his own thread-bare discourse
with the golden shreds of Cicero and
Virgil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been objected, and I fear
with some reason, that female conversation
is too frequently tinctured
with a censorious spirit, and that ladies
are seldom apt to discover much tenderness
for the errors of a fallen sister.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_58" id="sPage_58">[p 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If it be so, it is a grievous fault.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">No</span> arguments can justify, no pleas can
extenuate it. To insult over the miseries
of an unhappy creature is inhuman,
not to compassionate them is unchristian.
The worthy part of the
sex always express themselves humanely
on the failings of others, in proportion
to their own undeviating goodness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> here I cannot help remarking,
that young women do not always carefully
distinguish between running into
the error of detraction, and its opposite
extreme of indiscriminate applause.
This proceeds from the false idea they
entertain, that the direct contrary to
what is wrong must be right. Thus
the dread of being only suspected of
one fault makes them actually guilty
of another. The desire of avoiding<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_59" id="sPage_59">[p 59]</a></span>
the imputation of envy, impels them
to be insincere; and to establish a
reputation for sweetness of temper and
generosity, they affect sometimes to
speak of very indifferent characters
with the most extravagant applause.
With such, the hyperbole is a favourite
figure; and every degree of comparison
but the superlative is rejected,
as cold and inexpressive. But this
habit of exaggeration greatly weakens
their credit, and destroys the weight
of their opinion on other occasions;
for people very soon discover what degree
of faith is to be given both to
their judgment and veracity. And
those of real merit will no more be
flattered by that approbation, which
cannot distinguish the value of what
it praises, than the celebrated painter
must have been at the judgment passed<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_60" id="sPage_60">[p 60]</a></span>
on his works by an ignorant spectator,
who, being asked what he thought of
such and such very capital but very
different pieces, cried out in an affected
rapture, "All alike! all alike!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been proposed to the young,
as a maxim of supreme wisdom, to
manage so dexterously in conversation,
as to appear to be well acquainted
with subjects, of which they are totally
ignorant; and this, by affecting
silence in regard to those, on which
they are known to excel.&mdash;But why
counsel this disingenuous fraud? Why
add to the numberless arts of deceit,
this practice of deceiving, as it were,
on a settled principle? If to disavow
the knowledge they really have be a
culpable affectation, then certainly to
insinuate an idea of their skill, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_61" id="sPage_61">[p 61]</a></span>
they are actually ignorant, is a most
unworthy artifice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> of all the qualifications for
conversation, humility, if not the
most brilliant, is the safest, the most
amiable, and the most feminine. The
affectation of introducing subjects,
with which others are unacquainted,
and of displaying talents superior to
the rest of the company, is as dangerous
as it is foolish.</p>

<p>There are many, who never can
forgive another for being more agreeable
and more accomplished than
themselves, and who can pardon any
offence rather than an eclipsing merit.
Had the nightingale in the fable
conquered his vanity, and resisted
the temptation of shewing a fine voice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_62" id="sPage_62">[p 62]</a></span>
he might have escaped the talons of
the hawk. The melody of his singing
was the cause of his destruction; his
merit brought him into danger, and
his vanity cost him his life.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Envy</span>, (says Lord Bacon) has
no holidays." There cannot
perhaps be a more lively and striking
description of the miserable state of
mind those endure, who are tormented<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_64" id="sPage_64">[p 64]</a></span>
with this vice. A spirit of emulation
has been supposed to be the source of
the greatest improvements; and there
is no doubt but the warmest rivalship
will produce the most excellent effects;
but it is to be feared, that a perpetual
state of contest will injure the temper
so essentially, that the mischief will
hardly be counterbalanced by any
other advantages. Those, whose progress
is the most rapid, will be apt to
despise their less successful competitors,
who, in return, will feel the bitterest
resentment against their more
fortunate rivals. Among persons of
real goodness, this jealousy and contempt
can never be equally felt, because
every advancement in piety will
be attended with a proportionable increase
of humility, which will lead them
to contemplate their own improve<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_65" id="sPage_65">[p 65]</a></span>ments
with modesty, and to view
with charity the miscarriages of others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an envious man is melancholy,
one may ask him, in the words
of Bion, what evil has befallen himself,
or what good has happened to
another? This last is the scale by
which he principally measures his felicity,
and the very smiles of his friends
are so many deductions from his own
happiness. The wants of others are
the standard by which he rates his own
wealth, and he estimates his riches,
not so much by his own possessions,
as by the necessities of his neighbours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the malevolent intend to
strike a very deep and dangerous
stroke of malice, they generally begin
the most remotely in the world from<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_66" id="sPage_66">[p 66]</a></span>
the subject nearest their hearts. They
set out with commending the object
of their envy for some trifling quality
or advantage, which it is scarcely worth
while to possess: they next proceed to
make a general profession of their own
good-will and regard for him: thus
artfully removing any suspicion of
their design, and clearing all obstructions
for the insidious stab they are
about to give; for who will suspect
them of an intention to injure the object
of their peculiar and professed
esteem? The hearer's belief of the
fact grows in proportion to the seeming
reluctance with which it is told,
and to the conviction he has, that the
relater is not influenced by any private
pique, or personal resentment; but
that the confession is extorted from him
sorely against his inclination, and
purely on account of his zeal for truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_67" id="sPage_67">[p 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anger</span> is less reasonable and more
sincere than envy.&mdash;Anger breaks out
abruptly; envy is a great prefacer&mdash;anger
wishes to be understood at once:
envy is fond of remote hints and ambiguities;
but, obscure as its oracles
are, it never ceases to deliver them till
they are perfectly comprehended:&mdash;anger
repeats the same circumstances
over again; envy invents new ones at
every fresh recital&mdash;anger gives a
broken, vehement, and interrupted
narrative; envy tells a more consistent
and more probable, though a falser
tale&mdash;anger is excessively imprudent,
for it is impatient to disclose every
thing it knows; envy is discreet, for
it has a great deal to hide&mdash;anger never
consults times or seasons; envy
waits for the lucky moment, when the
wound it meditates may be made the
most exquisitely painful, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_68" id="sPage_68">[p 68]</a></span>
most incurably deep&mdash;anger uses more
invective; envy does more mischief&mdash;simple
anger soon runs itself out of
breath, and is exhausted at the end of
its tale; but it is for that chosen period
that envy has treasured up the most
barbed arrow in its whole quiver&mdash;anger
puts a man out of himself: but
the truly malicious generally preserve
the appearance of self-possession, or
they could not so effectually injure.&mdash;The
angry man sets out by destroying
his whole credit with you at once,
for he very frankly confesses his abhorrence
and detestation of the object of
his abuse; while the envious man carefully
suppresses all his own share in
the affair.&mdash;The angry man defeats the
end of his resentment, by keeping <i>himself</i>
continually before your eyes, instead
of his enemy; while the envious
man artfully brings forward the object<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_69" id="sPage_69">[p 69]</a></span>
of his malice, and keeps himself out
of sight.&mdash;The angry man talks loudly
of his own wrongs; the envious of his
adversary's injustice.&mdash;A passionate person,
if his resentments are not complicated
with malice, divides his time
between sinning and sorrowing; and,
as the irascible passions cannot constantly
be at work, his heart may sometimes
get a holiday.&mdash;Anger is a violent
act, envy a constant habit&mdash;no one can
be always angry, but he may be always
envious:&mdash;an angry man's enmity
(if he be generous) will subside when
the object of his resentment becomes
unfortunate; but the envious man can
extract food from his malice out of calamity
itself, if he finds his adversary
bears it with dignity, or is pitied or
assisted in it. The rage of the passionate
man is totally extinguished by
the death of his enemy; but the ha<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_70" id="sPage_70">[p 70]</a></span>tred
of the malicious is not buried even
in the grave of his rival: he will envy
the good name he has left behind him;
he will envy him the tears of his widow,
the prosperity of his children,
the esteem of his friends, the praises of
his epitaph&mdash;nay the very magnificence
of his funeral.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The</span> ear of jealousy heareth all
things," (says the wise man) frequently
I believe more than is uttered, which
makes the company of persons infected
with it still more dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> you tell those of a malicious
turn, any circumstance that has happened
to another, though they perfectly
know of whom you are speaking,
they often affect to be at a loss,
to forget his name, or to misapprehend
you in some respect or other; and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_71" id="sPage_71">[p 71]</a></span>
merely to have an opportunity of slily
gratifying their malice by mentioning
some unhappy defect or personal infirmity
he labours under; and not contented
"to tack his every error to his
name," they will, by way of farther
explanation, have recourse to the faults
of his father, or the misfortunes of
his family; and this with all the seeming
simplicity and candor in the world,
merely for the sake of preventing mistakes,
and to clear up every doubt of
his identity.&mdash;If you are speaking of a
lady, for instance, they will perhaps
embellish their inquiries, by asking if
you mean her, whose great grandfather
was a bankrupt, though she has the
vanity to keep a chariot, while others
who are much better born walk on
foot; or they will afterwards recollect,
that you may possibly mean her cousin,
of the same name, whose mother was<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_72" id="sPage_72">[p 72]</a></span>
suspected of such or such an indiscretion,
though the daughter had the luck
to make her fortune by marrying,
while her betters are overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> <i>hint at a fault</i>, does more mischief
than speaking out; for whatever
is left for the imagination to finish,
will not fail to be overdone: every
hiatus will be more then filled up, and
every pause more than supplied. There
is less malice, and less mischief too,
in telling a man's name than the initials
of it; as a worthier person may
be involved in the most disgraceful
suspicions by such a dangerous ambiguity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not uncommon for the envious,
after having attempted to deface
the fairest character so industriously,
that they are afraid you will begin to<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_73" id="sPage_73">[p 73]</a></span>
detect their malice, to endeavour to
remove your suspicions effectually, by
assuring you, that what they have just
related is only the popular opinion;
they themselves can never believe
things are so bad as they are said to
be; for their part, it is a rule with
them always to hope the best. It is
their way never to believe or report ill
of any one. They will, however,
mention the story in all companies,
that they may do their friend the service
of protesting their disbelief of it.
More reputations are thus hinted away
by false friends, than are openly destroyed
by public enemies. An <i>if</i>, or
a <i>but</i>, or a mortified look, or a languid
defence, or an ambiguous shake
of the head, or a hasty word affectedly
recalled, will demolish a character more
effectually, than the whole artillery of
malice when openly levelled against it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_74" id="sPage_74">[p 74]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not that envy never praises&mdash;No,
that would be making a public
profession of itself, and advertising
its own malignity; whereas the greatest
success of its efforts depends on the
concealment of their end. When envy
intends to strike a stroke of Machiavelian
policy, it sometimes affects the
language of the most exaggerated applause;
though it generally takes care,
that the subject of its panegyric shall
be a very indifferent and common character,
so that it is well aware none of
its praises will stick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the unhappy nature of envy
not to be contented with positive misery,
but to be continually aggravating
its own torments, by comparing
them with the felicities of others.
The eyes of envy are perpetually fixed
on the object which disturbs it, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_75" id="sPage_75">[p 75]</a></span>
can it avert them from it, though to
procure itself the relief of a temporary
forgetfulness. On seeing the innocence
of the first pair,</p>

<span class="i0">For Envy, yet with jealous leer malign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyed them askance.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As this enormous sin chiefly instigated
the revolt, and brought on the
ruin of the angelic spirits, so it is not
improbable, that it will be a principal
instrument of misery in a future world,
for the envious to compare their desperate
condition with the happiness of
the children of God; and to heighten
their actual wretchedness by reflecting
on what they have lost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> envy, like lying and ingratitude,
is practised with more frequency,
because it is practised with<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_76" id="sPage_76">[p 76]</a></span>
impunity; but there being no human
laws against these crimes, is so far from
an inducement to commit them, that
this very consideration would be sufficient
to deter the wise and good, if
all others were ineffectual; for of
how heinous a nature must those sins
be, which are judged above the reach
of human punishment, and are reserved
for the final justice of God himself!<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_77" id="sPage_77">[p 77]</a></span></p>




<h2><br /><br />
ON THE<br />
DANGER<br />
OF<br />
SENTIMENTAL OR ROMANTIC<br />
CONNEXIONS.<br />
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the many evils which
prevail under the sun, the abuse
of words is not the least considerable.
By the influence of time, and the perversion
of fashion, the plainest and
most unequivocal may be so altered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_78" id="sPage_78">[p 78]</a></span>
as to have a meaning assigned them almost
diametrically opposite to their
original signification.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present age may be termed, by
way of distinction, the age of sentiment,
a word which, in the implication
it now bears, was unknown to
our plain ancestors. Sentiment is the
varnish of virtue to conceal the deformity
of vice; and it is not uncommon
for the same persons to make a jest of
religion, to break through the most
solemn ties and engagements, to practise
every art of latent fraud and open
seduction, and yet to value themselves
on speaking and writing <i>sentimentally</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this refined jargon, which has
infested letters and tainted morals, is
chiefly admired and adopted by <i>young
ladies</i> of a certain turn, who read <i>sen<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_79" id="sPage_79">[p 79]</a></span>timental
books</i>, write <i>sentimental letters</i>,
and contract <i>sentimental friendships</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Error</span> is never likely to do so
much mischief as when it disguises its
real tendency, and puts on an engaging
and attractive appearance. Many
a young woman, who would be shocked
at the imputation of an intrigue,
is extremely flattered at the idea of a
sentimental connexion, though perhaps
with a dangerous and designing man,
who, by putting on this mask of plausibility
and virtue, disarms her of her
prudence, lays her apprehensions asleep,
and involves her in misery; misery
the more inevitable because unsuspected.
For she who apprehends no danger,
will not think it necessary to be
always upon her guard; but will rather
invite than avoid the ruin which<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_80" id="sPage_80">[p 80]</a></span>
comes under so specious and so fair a
form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> an engagement will be infinitely
dearer to her vanity than an
avowed and authorised attachment;
for one of these sentimental lovers will
not scruple very seriously to assure a credulous
girl, that her unparalleled merit
entitles her to the adoration of the
whole world, and that the universal
homage of mankind is nothing more
than the unavoidable tribute extorted
by her charms. No wonder then she
should be easily prevailed on to believe,
that an individual is captivated
by perfections which might enslave a
million. But she should remember,
that he who endeavours to intoxicate
her with adulation, intends one day
most effectually to humble her. For
an artful man has always a secret de<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_81" id="sPage_81">[p 81]</a></span>sign
to pay himself in future for every
present sacrifice. And this prodigality
of praise, which he now appears to
lavish with such thoughtless profusion,
is, in fact, a sum [oe]conomically laid
out to supply his future necessities:
of this sum he keeps an exact estimate,
and at some distant day promises himself
the most exorbitant interest for it.
If he has address and conduct, and,
the object of his pursuit much vanity,
and some sensibility, he seldom fails
of success; for so powerful will be his
ascendancy over her mind, that she
will soon adopt his notions and opinions.
Indeed, it is more than probable
she possessed most of them before, having
gradually acquired them in her
initiation into the sentimental character.
To maintain that character with
dignity and propriety, it is necessary
she should entertain the most elevated<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_82" id="sPage_82">[p 82]</a></span>
ideas of disproportionate alliances, and
disinterested love; and consider fortune,
rank, and reputation, as mere
chimerical distinctions and vulgar prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lover, deeply versed in all the
obliquities of fraud, and skilled to wind
himself into every avenue of the heart
which indiscretion has left unguarded,
soon discovers on which side it is most
accessible. He avails himself of this
weakness by addressing her in a language
exactly consonant to her own
ideas. He attacks her with her own
weapons, and opposes rhapsody to
sentiment&mdash;He professes so sovereign
a contempt for the paltry concerns of
money, that she thinks it her duty to
reward him for so generous a renunciation.
Every plea he artfully advances
of his own unworthiness, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_83" id="sPage_83">[p 83]</a></span>
considered by her as a fresh demand
which her gratitude must answer. And
she makes it a point of honour to sacrifice
to him that fortune which he
is too noble to regard. These professions
of humility are the common artifice
of the vain, and these protestations
of generosity the refuge of the
rapacious. And among its many
smooth mischiefs, it is one of the sure
and successful frauds of sentiment, to
affect the most frigid indifference to
those external and pecuniary advantages,
which it is its great and real
object to obtain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A sentimental</span> girl very rarely
entertains any doubt of her personal
beauty; for she has been daily accustomed
to contemplate it herself, and
to hear of it from others. She will
not, therefore, be very solicitous for<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_84" id="sPage_84">[p 84]</a></span>
the confirmation of a truth so self-evident;
but she suspects, that her
pretensions to understanding are more
likely to be disputed, and, for that
reason, greedily devours every compliment
offered to those perfections,
which are less obvious and more refined.
She is persuaded, that men
need only open their eyes to decide
on her beauty, while it will be the
most convincing proof of the taste,
sense, and elegance of her admirer,
that he can discern and flatter those
qualities in her. A man of the character
here supposed, will easily insinuate
himself into her affections, by
means of this latent but leading foible,
which may be called the guiding clue
to a sentimental heart. He will affect
to overlook that beauty which attracts
common eyes, and ensnares common
hearts, while he will bestow the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_85" id="sPage_85">[p 85]</a></span>
delicate praises on the beauties of her
mind, and finish the climax of adulation,
by hinting that she is superior
to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> nothing, in general, can end less
delightfully than these sublime attachments,
even where no acts of seduction
were ever practised, but they are
suffered, like mere sublunary connexions,
to terminate in the vulgar catastrophe
of marriage. That wealth,
which lately seemed to be looked on
with ineffable contempt by the lover,
now appears to be the principal attraction
in the eyes of the husband;
and he, who but a few short weeks
before, in a transport of sentimental
generosity, wished her to have been
a village maid, with no portion but<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_86" id="sPage_86">[p 86]</a></span>
her crook and her beauty, and that
they might spend their days in pastoral
love and innocence, has now lost all
relish for the Arcadian life, or any
other life in which she must be his
companion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other hand, she who was
lately</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An angel call'd, and angel-like ador'd,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is shocked to find herself at once stripped
of all her celestial attributes. This
late divinity, who scarcely yielded to
her sisters of the sky, now finds herself
of less importance in the esteem
of the man she has chosen, than any
other mere mortal woman. No longer
is she gratified with the tear of counterfeited
passion, the sigh of dissembled
rapture, or the language of premeditated
adoration. No longer is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_87" id="sPage_87">[p 87]</a></span>
altar of her vanity loaded with the oblations
of fictitious fondness, the incense
of falsehood, or the sacrifice of
flattery.&mdash;Her apotheosis is ended!&mdash;She
feels herself degraded from the
dignities and privileges of a goddess,
to all the imperfections, vanities, and
weaknesses of a slighted woman, and
a neglected wife. Her faults, which
were so lately overlooked, or mistaken
for virtues, are now, as Cassius says,
set in a note-book. The passion,
which was vowed eternal, lasted only
a few short weeks; and the indifference,
which was so far from being
included in the bargain, that it was
not so much as suspected, follows them
through the whole tiresome journey of
their insipid, vacant, joyless existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> much for the <i>completion</i> of the
sentimental history. If we trace it<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_88" id="sPage_88">[p 88]</a></span>
back to its beginning, we shall find
that a damsel of this cast had her head
originally turned by pernicious reading,
and her insanity confirmed by
imprudent friendships. She never fails
to select a beloved <i>confidante</i> of her
own turn and humour, though, if she
can help it, not quite so handsome as
herself. A violent intimacy ensues, or,
to speak the language of sentiment,
an intimate union of souls immediately
takes place, which is wrought to the
highest pitch by a secret and voluminous
correspondence, though they live
in the same street, or perhaps in the
same house. This is the fuel which
principally feeds and supplies the dangerous
flame of sentiment. In this
correspondence the two friends encourage
each other in the falsest notions
imaginable. They represent romantic
love as the great important busine<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_89" id="sPage_89">[p 89]</a></span>ss
of human life, and describe all the
other concerns of it as too low and
paltry to merit the attention of such
elevated beings, and fit only to employ
the daughters of the plodding
vulgar. In these letters, family affairs
are misrepresented, family secrets divulged,
and family misfortunes aggravated.
They are filled with vows
of eternal amity, and protestations of
never-ending love. But interjections
and quotations are the principal embellishments
of these very sublime
epistles. Every panegyric contained
in them is extravagant and hyperbolical,
and every censure exaggerated
and excessive. In a favourite, every
frailty is heightened into a perfection,
and in a foe degraded into a crime.
The dramatic poets, especially the
most tender and romantic, are quoted
in almost every line, and every pom<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_90" id="sPage_90">[p 90]</a></span>pous
or pathetic thought is forced to
give up its natural and obvious meaning,
and with all the violence of misapplication,
is compelled to suit some
circumstance of imaginary woe of the
fair transcriber. Alicia is not too mad
for her heroics, nor Monimia too mild
for her soft emotions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fathers</span> <i>have flinty hearts</i> is an expression
worth an empire, and is always
used with peculiar emphasis and
enthusiasm. For a favourite topic of
these epistles is the groveling spirit
and sordid temper of the parents, who
will be sure to find no quarter at the
hands of their daughters, should they
presume to be so unreasonable as to
direct their course of reading, interfere
in their choice of friends, or interrupt
their very important correspondence.
But as these young ladies are fertile in<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_91" id="sPage_91">[p 91]</a></span>
expedients, and as their genius is never
more agreeably exercised than in
finding resources, they are not without
their secret exultation, in case either
of the above interesting events
should happen, as they carry with
them a certain air of tyranny and persecution
which is very delightful. For
a prohibited correspondence is one of
the great incidents of a sentimental life,
and a letter clandestinely received, the
supreme felicity of a sentimental lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nothing</span> can equal the astonishment
of these soaring spirits, when their
plain friends or prudent relations presume
to remonstrate with them on any
impropriety in their conduct. But if
these worthy people happen to be
somewhat advanced in life, their contempt
is then a little softened by pity,
at the reflection that such very anti<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_92" id="sPage_92">[p 92]</a></span>quated
poor creatures should pretend
to judge what is fit or unfit for ladies
of their great refinement, sense, and
reading. They consider them as wretches
utterly ignorant of the sublime pleasures
of a delicate and exalted passion;
as tyrants whose authority is to be contemned,
and as spies whose vigilance is
to be eluded. The prudence of these
worthy friends they term suspicion,
and their experience dotage. For they
are persuaded, that the face of things
has so totally changed since their parents
were young, that though they
might then judge tolerably for themselves,
yet they are now (with all
their advantages of knowledge and
observation) by no means qualified to
direct their more enlightened daughters;
who, if they have made a great
progress in the sentimental walk, will<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_93" id="sPage_93">[p 93]</a></span>
no more be influenced by the advice
of their mother, than they would go
abroad in her laced pinner or her brocade
suit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> young people never shew their
folly and ignorance more conspicuously,
than by this over-confidence in
their own judgment, and this haughty
disdain of the opinion of those who
have known more days. Youth has
a quickness of apprehension, which it
is very apt to mistake for an acuteness
of penetration. But youth, like cunning,
though very conceited, is very
short-sighted, and never more so than
when it disregards the instructions of
the wife, and the admonitions of the
aged. The same vices and follies influenced
the human heart in their
day, which influence it now, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_94" id="sPage_94">[p 94]</a></span>
nearly in the same manner. One who
well knew the world and its various
vanities, has said, "The thing which
hath been, it is that which shall be,
and that which is done is that which
shall be done, and there is no new
thing under the sun."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is also a part of the sentimental
character, to imagine that none but
the young and the beautiful have any
right to the pleasures of society, of
even to the common benefits and blessings
of life. Ladies of this turn also
affect the most lofty disregard for useful
qualities and domestic virtues;
and this is a natural consequence: for
as this sort of sentiment is only a weed
of idleness, she who is constantly and
usefully employed, has neither leisure
nor propensity to cultivate it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_95" id="sPage_95">[p 95]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A sentimental</span> lady principally
values herself on the enlargement of
her notions, and her liberal way of
thinking. This superiority of soul
chiefly manifests itself in the contempt
of those minute delicacies and little decorums,
which, trifling as they may
be thought, tend at once to dignify
the character, and to restrain the
levity of the younger part of the sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the error here complained
of, originates in mistaking <i>sentiment</i>
and <i>principle</i> for each other. Now I
conceive them to be extremely different.
Sentiment is the virtue of <i>ideas</i>,
and principle the virtue of <i>action</i>. Sentiment
has its seat in the head, principle
in the heart. Sentiment suggests
fine harangues and subtile distinctions;
principle conceives just notions, and
performs good actions in consequence<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_96" id="sPage_96">[p 96]</a></span>
of them. Sentiment refines away the
simplicity of truth and the plainness
of piety; and, as a celebrated wit<a name="sFNanchor_6_6" id="sFNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#sFootnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has
remarked of his no less celebrated
contemporary, gives us virtue in words
and vice in deeds. Sentiment may be
called the Athenian, who <i>knew</i> what
was right, and principle the Lacedemonian
who <i>practised</i> it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> these qualities will be better
exemplified by an attentive consideration
of two admirably drawn characters
of Milton, which are beautifully,
delicately, and distinctly marked.
These are, Belial, who may not
improperly be called the <i>Demon of Sentiment</i>;
and Abdiel, who may be
termed the <i>Angel of Principle</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_97" id="sPage_97">[p 97]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> notwithstanding I have spoken
with some asperity against sentiment as
opposed to principle, yet I am con<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_101" id="sPage_101">[p 101]</a></span>vinced,
that true genuine sentiment,
(not the sort I have been describing)
may be so connected with principle,
as to bestow on it its brightest lustre,
and its most captivating graces. And
enthusiasm is so far from being disagreeable,
that a portion of it is perhaps
indispensably necessary in an engaging
woman. But it must be the
enthusiasm of the heart, not of the senses.
It must be the enthusiasm which grows
up with a feeling mind, and is cherished
by a virtuous education; not that which
is compounded of irregular passions, and
artificially refined by books of unnatural
fiction and improbable adventure.
I will even go so far as to assert,
that a young woman cannot have any
real greatness of soul, or true elevation
of principle, if she has not a tincture
of what the vulgar would call Romance,
but which persons of a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_102" id="sPage_102">[p 102]</a></span>
way of thinking will discern to proceed
from those fine feelings, and that
charming sensibility, without which,
though a woman may be worthy, yet
she can never be amiable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> this dangerous merit cannot be
too rigidly watched, as it is very apt
to lead those who possess it into inconveniencies
from which less interesting
characters are happily exempt. Young
women of strong sensibility may be
carried by the very amiableness of this
temper into the most alarming extremes.
Their tastes are passions. They
love and hate with all their hearts, and
scarcely suffer themselves to feel a reasonable
preference before it strengthens
into a violent attachment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an innocent girl of this open,
trusting, tender heart, happens to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_103" id="sPage_103">[p 103]</a></span>
with one of her own sex and age,
whose address and manners are engaging,
she is instantly seized with an ardent
desire to commence a friendship
with her. She feels the most lively
impatience at the restraints of company,
and the decorums of ceremony.
She longs to be alone with her, longs
to assure her of the warmth of her tenderness,
and generously ascribes to
the fair stranger all the good qualities
she feels in her own heart, or rather
all those which she has met with in her
reading, dispersed in a variety of heroines.
She is persuaded, that her new
friend unites them all in herself, because
she carries in her prepossessing
countenance the promise of them all.
How cruel and how censorious would
this inexperienced girl think her mother
was, who should venture to hint,
that the agreeable unknown had de<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_104" id="sPage_104">[p 104]</a></span>fects
in her temper, or exceptions in
her character. She would mistake these
hints of discretion for the insinuations
of an uncharitable disposition. At first
she would perhaps listen to them with
a generous impatience, and afterwards
with a cold and silent disdain. She
would despise them as the effect of
prejudice, misrepresentation, or ignorance.
The more aggravated the censure,
the more vehemently would she
protest in secret, that her friendship
for this dear injured creature (who is
raised much higher in her esteem by
such injurious suspicions) shall know
no bounds, as she is assured it can
know no end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> this trusting confidence, this
honest indiscretion, is, at this early period
of life as amiable as it is natural;
and will, if wisely cultivated, produce,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_105" id="sPage_105">[p 105]</a></span>
at its proper season, fruits infinitely
more valuable than all the guarded
circumspection of premature, and
therefore artificial, prudence. Men, I
believe, are seldom struck with these
sudden prepossessions in favour of each
other. They are not so unsuspecting,
nor so easily led away by the predominance
of fancy. They engage more
warily, and pass through the several
stages of acquaintance, intimacy, and
confidence, by slower gradations; but
women, if they are sometimes deceived
in the choice of a friend, enjoy even
then an higher degree of satisfaction
than if they never trusted. For to be
always clad in the burthensome armour
of suspicion is more painful and
inconvenient, than to run the hazard
of suffering now and then a transient
injury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_106" id="sPage_106">[p 106]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the above observations only
extend to the young and the inexperienced;
for I am very certain, that
women are capable of as faithful and
as durable friendship as any of the
other sex. They can enter not only
into all the enthusiastic tenderness,
but into all the solid fidelity of attachment.
And if we cannot oppose instances
of equal weight with those of
Nysus and Euryalus, Theseus and Pirithous,
Pylades and Orestes, let it be
remembered, that it is because the recorders
of those characters were men,
and that the very existence of them is
merely poetical.</p>

<h2><br /><br />
ON<br />
TRUE AND FALSE<br />
MEEKNESS.<br />
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A low</span> voice and soft address
are the common indications of
a well-bred woman, and should seem
to be the natural effects of a meek
and quiet spirit; but they are only the
outward and visible signs of it: for<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_108" id="sPage_108">[p 108]</a></span>
they are no more meekness itself, than
a red coat is courage, or a black one
devotion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> nothing is more common than
to mistake the sign for the thing itself;
nor is any practice more frequent than
that of endeavouring to acquire the
exterior mark, without once thinking
to labour after the interior grace. Surely
this is beginning at the wrong end,
like attacking the symptom and neglecting
the disease. To regulate the
features, while the soul is in tumults,
or to command the voice while the
passions are without restraint, is as idle
as throwing odours into a stream when
the source is polluted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>sapient king</i>, who knew better
than any man the nature and the power
of beauty, has assured us, that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_109" id="sPage_109">[p 109]</a></span>
temper of the mind has a strong influence
upon the features: "Wisdom
maketh the face to shine," says that
exquisite judge; and surely no part
of wisdom is more likely to produce
this amiable effect, than a placid serenity
of soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> will not be difficult to distinguish
the true from the artificial meekness.
The former is universal and habitual,
the latter, local and temporary. Every
young female may keep this rule by
her, to enable her to form a just judgment
of her own temper: if she is not
as gentle to her chambermaid as she
is to her visitor, she may rest satisfied
that the spirit of gentleness is not in
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Who</span> would not be shocked and
disappointed to behold a well-bred<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_110" id="sPage_110">[p 110]</a></span>
young lady, soft and engaging as the
doves of Venus, displaying a thousand
graces and attractions to win the hearts
of a large company, and the instant they
are gone, to see her look mad as the Pythian
maid, and all the frightened graces
driven from her furious countenance,
only because her gown was brought
home a quarter of an hour later than
she expected, or her ribbon sent half
a shade lighter or darker than she ordered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> men's characters are said to
proceed from their servants; and this
is more particularly true of ladies: for
as their situations are more domestic,
they lie more open to the inspection
of their families, to whom their real
characters are easily and perfectly
known; for they seldom think it worth
while to practise any disguise before<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_111" id="sPage_111">[p 111]</a></span>
those, whose good opinion they do not
value, and who are obliged to submit
to their most insupportable humours,
because they are paid for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> women of breeding, the
exterior of gentleness is so uniformly
assumed, and the whole manner is so
perfectly level and <i>uni</i>, that it is
next to impossible for a stranger to
know any thing of their true dispositions
by conversing with them, and
even the very features are so exactly
regulated, that physiognomy, which
may sometimes be trusted among the
vulgar, is, with the polite, a most
lying science.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A very</span> termagant woman, if she
happens also to be a very artful one,
will be conscious she has so much to
conceal, that the dread of betraying<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_112" id="sPage_112">[p 112]</a></span>
her real temper will make her put on
an over-acted softness, which, from its
very excess, may be distinguished from
the natural, by a penetrating eye. That
gentleness is ever liable to be suspected
for the counterfeited, which is so excessive
as to deprive people of the proper
use of speech and motion, or
which, as Hamlet says, makes them
lisp and amble, and nick-name God's
creatures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> countenance and manners of
some very fashionable persons may be
compared to the inscriptions on their
monuments, which speak nothing but
good of what is within; but he who
knows any thing of the world, or of
the human heart, will no more trust
to the courtesy, than he will depend
on the epitaph.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_113" id="sPage_113">[p 113]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> the various artifices of factitious
meekness, one of the most frequent
and most plausible, is that of
affecting to be always equally delighted
with all persons and all characters. The
society of these languid beings is without
confidence, their friendship without
attachment, and their love without
affection, or even preference. This
insipid mode of conduct may be safe,
but I cannot think it has either taste,
sense, or principle in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> uniformly smiling and approving
ladies, who have neither the
noble courage to reprehend vice, nor
the generous warmth to bear their honest
testimony in the cause of virtue,
conclude every one to be ill-natured
who has any penetration, and look upon
a distinguishing judgment as want
of tenderness. But they should learn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_114" id="sPage_114">[p 114]</a></span>
that this discernment does not always
proceed from an uncharitable temper,
but from that long experience and
thorough knowledge of the world,
which lead those who have it to scrutinize
into the conduct and disposition
of men, before they trust entirely to
those fair appearances, which sometimes
veil the most insidious purposes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are perpetually mistaking the
qualities and dispositions of our own
hearts. We elevate our failings into
virtues, and qualify our vices into
weaknesses: and hence arise so many
false judgments respecting meekness.
Self-ignorance is at the root of all this
mischief. Many ladies complain that,
for their part, their spirit is so meek
they can bear nothing; whereas, if
they spoke truth, they would say, their
spirit is so high and unbroken that<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_115" id="sPage_115">[p 115]</a></span>
they can bear nothing. Strange! to
plead their meekness as a reason why
they cannot endure to be crossed, and
to produce their impatience of contradiction
as a proof of their gentleness!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meekness</span>, like most other virtues,
has certain limits, which it no sooner
exceeds than it becomes criminal. Servility
of spirit is not gentleness but
weakness, and if allowed, under the
specious appearances it sometimes puts
on, will lead to the most dangerous
compliances. She who hears innocence
maligned without vindicating it,
falsehood asserted without contradicting
it, or religion prophaned without
resenting it, is not gentle but wicked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> give up the cause of an innocent,
injured friend, if the popular cry happens
to be against him, is the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_116" id="sPage_116">[p 116]</a></span>
disgraceful weakness. This was the
case of Madame de Maintenon. She
loved the character and admired the
talents of Racine; she caressed him
while he had no enemies, but wanted
the greatness of mind, or rather the
common justice, to protect him against
their resentment when he had; and
her favourite was abandoned to the
suspicious jealousy of the king, when
a prudent remonstrance might have
preserved him.&mdash;But her tameness, if
not absolute connivance in the great
massacre of the protestants, in whose
church she had been bred, is a far
more guilty instance of her weakness;
an instance which, in spite of all her
devotional zeal and incomparable prudence,
will disqualify her from shining
in the annals of good women, however
she may be entitled to figure
among the great and the fortunate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_117" id="sPage_117">[p 117]</a></span>
Compare her conduct with that of her
undaunted and pious countryman and
contemporary, Bougi, who, when
Louis would have prevailed on him
to renounce his religion for a commission
or a government, nobly replied,
"If I could be persuaded to betray
my God for a marshal's staff, I
might betray my king for a bribe
of much less consequence."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meekness</span> is imperfect, if it be not
both active and passive; if it will not
enable us to subdue our own passions
and resentments, as well as qualify us
to bear patiently the passions and resentments
of others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we give way to any violent
emotion of anger, it would perhaps be
worth while to consider the value of
the object which excites it, and to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_118" id="sPage_118">[p 118]</a></span>flect
for a moment, whether the thing
we so ardently desire, or so vehemently
resent, be really of as much importance
to us, as that delightful tranquillity
of soul, which we renounce in
pursuit of it. If, on a fair calculation,
we find we are not likely to get as
much as we are sure to lose, then,
putting all religious considerations out
of the question, common sense and
human policy will tell us, we have
made a foolish and unprofitable exchange.
Inward quiet is a part of
one's self; the object of our resentment
may be only a matter of opinion; and,
certainly, what makes a portion of
our actual happiness ought to be too
dear to us, to be sacrificed for a trifling,
foreign, perhaps imaginary good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most pointed satire I remember
to have read, on a mind enslaved by<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_119" id="sPage_119">[p 119]</a></span>
anger, is an observation of Seneca's.
"Alexander (said he) had two friends,
Clitus and Lysimachus; the one he
exposed to a lion, the other to himself:
he who was turned loose to the
beast escaped, but Clitus was murdered,
for he was turned loose to an
angry man."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A passionate</span> woman's happiness
is never in her own keeping: it is the
sport of accident, and the slave of
events. It is in the power of her acquaintance,
her servants, but chiefly
of her enemies, and all her comforts
lie at the mercy of others. So far
from being willing to learn of him
who was meek and lowly, she considers
meekness as the want of a becoming
spirit, and lowliness as a despicable
and vulgar meanness. And an imperious
woman will so little covet the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_120" id="sPage_120">[p 120]</a></span>
ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
that it is almost the only ornament she
will not be solicitous to wear. But resentment
is a very expensive vice. How
dearly has it cost its votaries, even
from the sin of Cain, the first offender
in this kind! "It is cheaper (says a
pious writer) to forgive, and save
the charges."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it were only for mere human reasons,
it would turn to a better account
to be patient; nothing defeats the malice
of an enemy like a spirit of forbearance;
the return of rage for rage
cannot be so effectually provoking.
True gentleness, like an impenetrable
armour, repels the most pointed shafts
of malice: they cannot pierce through
this invulnerable shield, but either fall
hurtless to the ground, or return to
wound the hand that shot them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_121" id="sPage_121">[p 121]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A meek</span> spirit will not look out of itself
for happiness, because it finds a
constant banquet at home; yet, by a
sort of divine alchymy, it will convert
all external events to its own profit,
and be able to deduce some good, even
from the most unpromising: it will extract
comfort and satisfaction from the
most barren circumstances: "It will
suck honey out of the rock, and oil
out of the flinty rock."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the supreme excellence of this
complacent quality is, that it naturally
disposes the mind where it resides, to
the practice of every other that is amiable.
Meekness may be called the
pioneer of all the other virtues, which
levels every obstruction, and smooths
every difficulty that might impede
their entrance, or retard their progress.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_122" id="sPage_122">[p 122]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> peculiar importance and value
of this amiable virtue may be farther
seen in its permanency. Honours and
dignities are transient, beauty and
riches frail and fugacious, to a proverb.
Would not the truly wise,
therefore, wish to have some one possession,
which they might call their own
in the severest exigencies? But this
wish can only be accomplished by acquiring
and maintaining that calm and
absolute self-possession, which, as the
world had no hand in giving, so it
cannot, by the most malicious exertion
of its power, take away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_123" id="sPage_123">[p 123]</a></span></p>

<span class="smcap">in the</span><br />

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> not the foolish presumption
to imagine, that I can offer
any thing new on a subject, which
has been so successfully treated by
many learned and able writers. I would
only, with all possible deference, beg<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_124" id="sPage_124">[p 124]</a></span>
leave to hazard a few short remarks
on that part of the subject of education,
which I would call the <i>education
of the heart</i>. I am well aware, that
this part also has not been less skilfully
and forcibly discussed than the
rest, though I cannot, at the same
time, help remarking, that it does
not appear to have been so much
adopted into common practice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears then, that notwithstanding
the great and real improvements,
which have been made in the affair
of female education, and notwithstanding
the more enlarged and generous
views of it, which prevail in the present
day, that there is still a very material
defect, which it is not, in general,
enough the object of attention to remove.
This defect seems to consist
in this, that too little regard is paid<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_125" id="sPage_125">[p 125]</a></span>
to the dispositions of the <i>mind</i>, that
the indications of the <i>temper</i> are not
properly cherished, nor the affections
of the <i>heart</i> sufficiently regulated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the first education of girls, as
far as the customs which fashion establishes
are right, they should undoubtedly
be followed. Let the exterior be
made a considerable object of attention,
but let it not be the principal, let it
not be the only one.&mdash;Let the graces
be industriously cultivated, but let
them not be cultivated at the expence
of the virtues.&mdash;Let the arms, the
head, the whole person be carefully
polished, but let not the heart be the
only portion of the human anatomy,
which shall be totally overlooked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> neglect of this cultivation seems
to proceed as much from a bad taste,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_126" id="sPage_126">[p 126]</a></span>
as from a false principle. The generality
of people form their judgment
of education by slight and sudden appearances,
which is certainly a wrong
way of determining. Music, dancing,
and languages, gratify those who teach
them, by perceptible and almost immediate
effects; and when there happens
to be no imbecillity in the pupil, nor
deficiency in the matter, every superficial
observer can, in some measure,
judge of the progress.&mdash;The effects of
most of these accomplishments address
themselves to the senses; and there are
more who can see and hear, than there
are who can judge and reflect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Personal</span> perfection is not only
more obvious, it is also more rapid;
and even in very accomplished characters,
elegance usually precedes principle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_127" id="sPage_127">[p 127]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the heart, that natural seat of
evil propensities, that little troublesome
empire of the passions, is led to
what is right by slow motions and imperceptible
degrees. It must be admonished
by reproof, and allured by
kindness. Its liveliest advances are
frequently impeded by the obstinacy
of prejudice, and its brightest promises
often obscured by the tempests
of passion. It is slow in its acquisition
of virtue, and reluctant in its approaches
to piety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another reason, which
proves this mental cultivation to be
more important, as well as more difficult,
than any other part of education.
In the usual fashionable accomplishments,
the business of acquiring them
is almost always getting forwards, and
one difficulty is conquered before an<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_128" id="sPage_128">[p 128]</a></span>other
is suffered to shew itself; for a
prudent teacher will level the road his
pupil is to pass, and smooth the inequalities
which might retard her progress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in morals, (which should be
the great object constantly kept in
view) the talk is far more difficult.
The unruly and turbulent desires of
the heart are not so obedient; one passion
will start up before another is suppressed.
The subduing Hercules cannot
cut off the heads so often as the
prolific Hydra can produce them, nor
fell the stubborn Ant&aelig;us so fast as he
can recruit his strength, and rise in
vigorous and repeated opposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> all the accomplishments could be
bought at the price of a single virtue,
the purchase would be infinitely dear!<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_129" id="sPage_129">[p 129]</a></span>
And, however startling it may sound,
I think it is, notwithstanding, true,
that the labours of a good and wise
mother, who is anxious for her daughter's
most important interests, will <i>seem</i>
to be at variance with those of her instructors.
She will doubtless rejoice
at her progress in any polite art, but
she will rejoice with trembling:&mdash;humility
and piety form the solid and
durable basis, on which she wishes to
raise the superstructure of the accomplishments,
while the accomplishments
themselves are frequently of that unsteady
nature, that if the foundation
is not secured, in proportion as the
building is enlarged, it will be overloaded
and destroyed by those very
ornaments, which were intended to
embellish, what they have contributed
to ruin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_130" id="sPage_130">[p 130]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> more ostensible qualifications
should be carefully regulated, or they
will be in danger of putting to flight
the modest train of retreating virtues,
which cannot safely subsist before the
bold eye of public observation, or
bear the bolder tongue of impudent
and audacious flattery. A tender mother
cannot but feel an honest triumph,
in contemplating those excellencies in
her daughter which deserve applause,
but she will also shudder at the vanity
which that applause may excite, and
at those hitherto unknown ideas which
it may awaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> master, it is his interest, and
perhaps his duty, will naturally teach
a girl to set her improvements in the
most conspicuous point of light. <span class="smcap">Se
faire valoir</span> is the great principle
industriously inculcated into her young<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_131" id="sPage_131">[p 131]</a></span>
heart, and seems to be considered as
a kind of fundamental maxim in education.
It is however the certain and
effectual seed, from which a thousand
yet unborn vanities will spring. This
dangerous doctrine (which yet is not
without its uses) will be counteracted
by the prudent mother, not in so
many words, but by a watchful and
scarcely perceptible dexterity. Such
an one will be more careful to have
the talents of her daughter <i>cultivated</i>
than <i>exhibited</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> would be led to imagine, by
the common mode of female education,
that life consisted of one universal
holiday, and that the only contest
was, who should be best enabled
to excel in the sports and games that
were to be celebrated on it. Merely
ornamental accomplishments will but<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_132" id="sPage_132">[p 132]</a></span>
indifferently qualify a woman to perform
the <i>duties</i> of life, though it is
highly proper she should possess them,
in order to furnish the <i>amusements</i> of
it. But is it right to spend so large
a portion of life without some preparation
for the business of living? A
lady may speak a little French and
Italian, repeat a few passages in a theatrical
tone, play and sing, have her
dressing-room hung with her own drawings,
and her person covered with her
own tambour work, and may, notwithstanding,
have been very <i>badly
educated</i>. Yet I am far from attempting
to depreciate the value of these
qualifications: they are most of them
not only highly becoming, but often
indispensably necessary, and a polite
education cannot be perfected without
them. But as the world seems to
be very well apprised of their import<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_133" id="sPage_133">[p 133]</a></span>ance,
there is the less occasion to insist
on their utility. Yet, though well-bred
young women should learn to
dance, sing, recite and draw, the end
of a good education is not that they
may become dancers, singers, players
or painters: its real object is to make
them good daughters, good wives,
good mistresses, good members of society,
and good christians. The above
qualifications therefore are intended to
<i>adorn</i> their <i>leisure</i>, not to <i>employ</i> their
<i>lives</i>; for an amiable and wise woman
will always have something better to
value herself on, than these advantages,
which, however captivating,
are still but subordinate parts of a truly
excellent character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> I am afraid parents themselves
sometimes contribute to the error of
which I am complaining. Do they<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_134" id="sPage_134">[p 134]</a></span>
not often set a higher value on those
acquisitions which are calculated to
attract observation, and catch the eye
of the multitude, than on those which
are valuable, permanent, and internal?
Are they not sometimes more solicitous
about the opinion of others, respecting
their children, than about
the real advantage and happiness of
the children themselves? To an injudicious
and superficial eye, the best
educated girl may make the least brilliant
figure, as she will probably have
less flippancy in her manner, and less
repartee in her expression; and her acquirements,
to borrow bishop Sprat's
idea, will be rather <i>enamelled than embossed</i>.
But her merit will be known,
and acknowledged by all who come
near enough to discern, and have taste
enough to distinguish. It will be understood
and admired by the man,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_135" id="sPage_135">[p 135]</a></span>
whose happiness she is one day to
make, whose family she is to govern,
and whose children she is to educate.
He will not seek for her in the haunts
of dissipation, for he knows he shall
not find her there; but he will seek
for her in the bosom of retirement, in
the practice of every domestic virtue,
in the exertion of every amiable accomplishment,
exerted in the shade, to
enliven retirement, to heighten the
endearing pleasures of social intercourse,
and to embellish the narrow
but charming circle of family delights.
To this amiable purpose, a truly good
and well educated young lady will dedicate
her more elegant accomplishments,
instead of exhibiting them to attract
admiration, or depress inferiority.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young</span> girls, who have more vivacity
than understanding, will often<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_136" id="sPage_136">[p 136]</a></span>
make a sprightly figure in conversation.
But this agreeable talent for entertaining
others, is frequently dangerous to
themselves, nor is it by any means to
be desired or encouraged very early in
life. This immaturity of wit is helped
on by frivolous reading, which will
produce its effect in much less time
than books of solid instruction; for the
imagination is touched sooner than the
understanding; and effects are more
rapid as they are more pernicious.
Conversation should be the <i>result</i> of
education, not the <i>precursor</i> of it. It
is a golden fruit, when suffered to
grow gradually on the tree of knowledge;
but if precipitated by forced
and unnatural means, it will in the
end become vapid, in proportion as it
is artificial.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_137" id="sPage_137">[p 137]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best effects of a careful and
religious education are often very remote:
they are to be discovered in
future scenes, and exhibited in untried
connexions. Every event of life will
be putting the heart into fresh situations,
and making demands on its
prudence, its firmness, its integrity,
or its piety. Those whose business it
is to form it, can foresee none of these
situations; yet, as far as human wisdom
will allow, they must enable it
to provide for them all, with an humble
dependence on the divine assistance.
A well-disciplined soldier must learn
and practise all his evolutions, though
he does not know on what service his
leader may command him, by what
foe he shall be attacked, nor what
mode of combat the enemy may
use.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_138" id="sPage_138">[p 138]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> great art of education consists
in not suffering the feelings to become
too acute by unnecessary awakening,
nor too obtuse by the want of exertion.
The former renders them the source
of calamity, and totally ruins the temper;
while the latter blunts and debases
them, and produces a dull, cold,
and selfish spirit. For the mind is an
instrument, which, if wound too high,
will lose its sweetness, and if not
enough strained, will abate of its vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> cruel is it to extinguish by
neglect or unkindness, the precious
sensibility of an open temper, to chill
the amiable glow of an ingenuous soul,
and to quench the bright flame of a
noble and generous spirit! These are
of higher worth than all the documents
of learning, of dearer price than all<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_139" id="sPage_139">[p 139]</a></span>
the advantages, which can be derived
from the most refined and artificial
mode of education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> sensibility and delicacy, and an
ingenuous temper, make no part of
education, exclaims the pedagogue&mdash;they
are reducible to no class&mdash;they
come under no article of instruction&mdash;they
belong neither to languages nor
to music.&mdash;What an error! They <i>are</i>
a part of education, and of infinitely
more value,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Than all their pedant discipline e'er knew.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is true, they are ranged under no
class, but they are superior to all;
they are of more esteem than languages
or music, for they are the language of
the heart, and the music of the according
passions. Yet this sensibility is,
in many instances, so far from being<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_140" id="sPage_140">[p 140]</a></span>
cultivated, that it is not uncommon
to see those who affect more than usual
sagacity, cast a smile of supercilious
pity, at any indication of a warm,
generous, or enthusiastic temper in the
lively and the young; as much as to
say, "they will know better, and will
have more discretion when they are
older." But every appearance of
amiable simplicity, or of honest shame,
<i>Nature's hasty conscience</i>, will be dear
to sensible hearts; they will carefully
cherish every such indication in a
young female; for they will perceive
that it is this temper, wisely cultivated,
which will one day make her
enamoured of the loveliness of virtue,
and the beauty of holiness: from
which she will acquire a taste for the
doctrines of religion, and a spirit to
perform the duties of it. And those
who wish to make her ashamed of<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_141" id="sPage_141">[p 141]</a></span>
this charming temper, and seek to dispossess
her of it, will, it is to be feared,
give her nothing better in exchange.
But whoever reflects at all, will easily
discern how carefully this enthusiasm
is to be directed, and how judiciously
its redundances are to be lopped
away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prudence</span> is not natural to children;
they can, however, substitute
art in its stead. But is it not much
better that a girl should discover the
faults incident to her age, than conceal
them under this dark and impenetrable
veil? I could almost venture
to assert, that there is something more
becoming in the very errors of nature,
where they are undisguised, than in the
affectation of virtue itself, where the
reality is wanting. And I am so far
from being an admirer of prodigies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_142" id="sPage_142">[p 142]</a></span>
that I am extremely apt to suspect
them; and am always infinitely better
pleased with Nature in her more common
modes of operation. The precise
and premature wisdom, which some
girls have cunning enough to assume,
is of a more dangerous tendency than
any of their natural failings can be,
as it effectually covers those secret bad
dispositions, which, if they displayed
themselves, might be rectified. The
hypocrisy of assuming virtues which
are not inherent in the heart, prevents
the growth and disclosure of those real
ones, which it is the great end of education
to cultivate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> if the natural indications of the
temper are to be suppressed and stifled,
where are the diagnostics, by which
the state of the mind is to be known?
The wise Author of all things, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_143" id="sPage_143">[p 143]</a></span>
did nothing in vain, doubtless intended
them as symptoms, by which to
judge of the diseases of the heart;
and it is impossible diseases should be
cured before they are known. If the
stream be so cut off as to prevent communication,
or so choked up as to
defeat discovery, how shall we ever
reach the source, out of which are the
issues of life?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> cunning, which, of all the
different dispositions girls discover, is
most to be dreaded, is increased by
nothing so much as by fear. If those
about them express violent and unreasonable
anger at every trivial offence,
it will always promote this temper,
and will very frequently create it,
where there was a natural tendency to
frankness. The indiscreet transports
of rage, which many betray on every<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_144" id="sPage_144">[p 144]</a></span>
slight occasion, and the little distinction
they make between venial errors
and premeditated crimes, naturally
dispose a child to conceal, what she
does not however care to suppress.
Anger in one will not remedy the faults
of another; for how can an instrument
of sin cure sin? If a girl is kept in
a state of perpetual and slavish terror,
she will perhaps have artifice enough
to conceal those propensities which
she knows are wrong, or those actions
which she thinks are most obnoxious
to punishment. But, nevertheless, she
will not cease to indulge those propensities,
and to commit those actions,
when she can do it with impunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> <i>dispositions</i>, of themselves, will
go but a very little way, unless they
are confirmed into good <i>principles</i>.
And this cannot be effected but by a<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_145" id="sPage_145">[p 145]</a></span>
careful course of religious instruction,
and a patient and laborious cultivation
of the moral temper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, notwithstanding girls should
not be treated with unkindness, nor
the first openings of the passions blighted
by cold severity; yet I am of opinion,
that young females should be
accustomed very early in life to a certain
degree of restraint. The natural
cast of character, and the moral distinctions
between the sexes, should
not be disregarded, even in childhood.
That bold, independent, enterprising
spirit, which is so much admired in
boys, should not, when it happens to
discover itself in the other sex, be encouraged,
but suppressed. Girls should
be taught to give up their opinions
betimes, and not pertinaciously to carry
on a dispute, even if they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_146" id="sPage_146">[p 146]</a></span>
know themselves to be in the right.
I do not mean, that they should be
robbed of the liberty of private judgment,
but that they should by no
means be encouraged to contract a
contentious or contradictory turn. It
is of the greatest importance to their
future happiness, that they should acquire
a submissive temper, and a forbearing
spirit: for it is a lesson which
the world will not fail to make them
frequently practise, when they come
abroad into it, and they will not practise
it the worse for having learnt it
the sooner. These early restraints, in
the limitation here meant, are so far
from being an effect of cruelty, that
they are the most indubitable marks of
affection, and are the more meritorious,
as they are severe trials of tenderness.
But all the beneficial effects, which a
mother can expect from this watch<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_147" id="sPage_147">[p 147]</a></span>fulness,
will be entirely defeated, if
it is practised occasionally, and not
habitually, and if it ever appears to
be used to gratify caprice, ill-humour,
or resentment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who have children to educate
ought to be extremely patient:
it is indeed a labour of love. They
should reflect, that extraordinary talents
are neither essential to the well-being
of society, nor to the happiness
of individuals. If that had been the
case, the beneficent Father of the universe
would not have made them so
rare. For it is as easy for an Almighty
Creator to produce a Newton, as an
ordinary man; and he could have made
those powers common which we now
consider as wonderful, without any
miraculous exertion of his omnipotence,
if the existence of many New<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_148" id="sPage_148">[p 148]</a></span>tons
had been necessary to the perfection
of his wise and gracious plan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surely</span>, therefore, there is more
piety, as well as more sense, in labouring
to improve the talents which children
actually have, than in lamenting
that they do not possess supernatural
endowments or angelic perfections. A
passage of Lord Bacon's furnishes an
admirable incitement for endeavouring
to carry the amiable and christian
grace of charity to its farthest extent,
instead of indulging an over-anxious
care for more brilliant but less important
acquisitions. "The desire of
power in excess (says he) caused the
angels to fall; the desire of knowledge
in excess caused man to fall;
but in charity is no excess, neither
can men nor angels come into danger
by it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_149" id="sPage_149">[p 149]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A girl</span> who has docility will seldom
be found to want understanding enough
for all the purposes of a social, a happy,
and an useful life. And when
we behold the tender hope of fond
and anxious love, blasted by disappointment,
the defect will as often be
discovered to proceed from the neglect
or the error of cultivation, as from the
natural temper; and those who lament
the evil, will sometimes be found to
have occasioned it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is as injudicious for parents to set
out with too sanguine a dependence
on the merit of their children, as it is
for them to be discouraged at every
repulse. When their wishes are defeated
in this or that particular instance,
where they had treasured up
some darling expectation, this is so far
from being a reason for relaxing their<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_150" id="sPage_150">[p 150]</a></span>
attention, that it ought to be an additional
motive for redoubling it. Those
who hope to do a great deal, must not
expect to do every thing. If they
know any thing of the malignity of
sin, the blindness of prejudice, or the
corruption of the human heart, they
will also know, that that heart will always
remain, after the very best possible
education, full of infirmity and imperfection.
Extraordinary allowances, therefore,
must be made for the weakness
of nature in this its weakest state. After
much is done, much will remain to
do, and much, very much, will still
be left undone. For this regulation
of the passions and affections cannot
be the work of education alone, without
the concurrence of divine grace
operating on the heart. Why then
should parents repine, if their efforts
are not always crowned with imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_151" id="sPage_151">[p 151]</a></span>diate
success? They should consider,
that they are not educating cherubims
and seraphims, but men and women;
creatures, who at their best estate are altogether
vanity: how little then can be
expected from them in the weakness
and imbecillity of infancy! I have dwelt
on this part of the subject the longer,
because I am certain that many, who
have set out with a warm and active
zeal, have cooled on the very first
discouragement, and have afterwards
almost totally remitted their vigilance,
through a criminal kind of despair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> allowances must be made
for a profusion of gaiety, loquacity,
and even indiscretion in children, that
there may be animation enough left to
supply an active and useful character,
when the first fermentation of the
youthful passions is over, and the re<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_152" id="sPage_152">[p 152]</a></span>dundant
spirits shall come to subside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it be true, as a consummate judge
of human nature has observed,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That not a vanity is given in vain,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>it is also true, that there is scarcely a
single passion, which may not be turned
to some good account, if prudently
rectified, and skilfully turned into the
road of some neighbouring virtue. It
cannot be violently bent, or unnaturally
forced towards an object of a
totally opposite nature, but may be
gradually inclined towards a correspondent
but superior affection. Anger,
hatred, resentment, and ambition, the
most restless and turbulent passions
which shake and distract the human
soul, may be led to become the most
active opposers of sin, after having<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_153" id="sPage_153">[p 153]</a></span>
been its most successful instruments.
Our anger, for instance, which can
never be totally subdued, may be made
to turn against ourselves, for our weak
and imperfect obedience&mdash;our hatred,
against every species of vice&mdash;our ambition,
which will not be discarded,
may be ennobled: it will not change
its name, but its object: it will despise
what it lately valued, nor be
contented to grasp at less than immortality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> the joys, fears, hopes, desires,
all the passions and affections, which
separate in various currents from the
soul, will, if directed into their proper
channels, after having fertilised
wherever they have flowed, return
again to swell and enrich the parent
source.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_154" id="sPage_154">[p 154]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the very passions which appear
the most uncontroulable and unpromising,
may be intended, in the great
scheme of Providence, to answer some
important purpose, is remarkably evidenced
in the character and history
of Saint Paul. A remark on this subject
by an ingenious old Spanish writer,
which I will here take the liberty
to translate, will better illustrate my
meaning.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">To</span> convert the bitterest enemy
into the most zealous advocate, is
the work of God for the instruction
of man. Plutarch has observed,
that the medical science would be
brought to the utmost perfection,
when poison should be converted
into physic. Thus, in the mortal
disease of Judaism and idolatry,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_155" id="sPage_155">[p 155]</a></span>
our blessed Lord converted the adder's
venom of Saul the persecutor,
into that cement which made Paul
the chosen vessel. That manly activity,
that restless ardor, that
burning zeal for the law of his
fathers, that ardent thirst for the
blood of Christians, did the Son
of God find necessary in the man
who was one day to become the
defender of his suffering people.<a name="sFNanchor_7_7" id="sFNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#sFootnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> win the passions, therefore, over
to the cause of virtue, answers a much
nobler end than their extinction would
possibly do, even if that could be effected.
But it is their nature never
to observe a neutrality; they are either
rebels or auxiliaries, and an
enemy subdued is an ally obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_156" id="sPage_156">[p 156]</a></span>
If I may be allowed to change the allusion
so soon, I would say, that the
passions also resemble fires, which are
friendly and beneficial when under proper
direction, but if suffered to blaze
without restraint, they carry devastation
along with them, and, if totally extinguished,
leave the benighted mind
in a state of cold and comfortless inanity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in speaking of the usefulness
of the passions, as instruments of virtue,
<i>envy</i> and <i>lying</i> must always be
excepted: these, I am persuaded, must
either go on in still progressive mischief,
or else be radically cured, before
any good can be expected from
the heart which has been infected with
them. For I never will believe that
envy, though passed through all the
moral strainers, can be refined into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_157" id="sPage_157">[p 157]</a></span>
virtuous emulation, or lying improved
into an agreeable turn for innocent invention.
Almost all the other passions
may be made to take an amiable
hue; but these two must either be totally
extirpated, or be always contented
to preserve their original deformity,
and to wear their native black.</p>

</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Various</span> are the reasons why
the greater part of mankind cannot
apply themselves to arts or letters.
Particular studies are only suited to
the capacities of particular persons.
Some are incapable of applying to<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_159" id="sPage_159">[p 159]</a></span>
them from the delicacy of their sex,
some from the unsteadiness of youth,
and others from the imbecillity of age.
Many are precluded by the narrowness
of their education, and many by
the straitness of their fortune. The
wisdom of God is wonderfully manifested
in this happy and well-ordered
diversity, in the powers and properties
of his creatures; since by thus admirably
suiting the agent to the action,
the whole scheme of human affairs is
carried on with the most agreeing and
consistent [oe]conomy, and no chasm is
left for want of an object to fill it, exactly
suited to its nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> in the great and universal concern
of religion, both sexes, and all
ranks, are equally interested. The
truly catholic spirit of christianity accommodates
itself, with an astonish<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_160" id="sPage_160">[p 160]</a></span>ing
condescension, to the circumstances
of the whole human race. It rejects
none on account of their pecuniary
wants, their personal infirmities, or
their intellectual deficiencies. No superiority
of parts is the least recommendation,
nor is any depression of
fortune the smallest objection. None
are too wise to be excused from performing
the duties of religion, nor are
any too poor to be excluded from the
consolations of its promises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we admire the wisdom of God,
in having furnished different degrees
of intelligence, so exactly adapted to
their different destinations, and in having
fitted every part of his stupendous work,
not only to serve its own immediate
purpose, but also to contribute to the
beauty and perfection of the whole:
how much more ought we to adore<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_161" id="sPage_161">[p 161]</a></span>
that goodness, which has perfected the
divine plan, by appointing one wide,
comprehensive, and universal means
of salvation: a salvation, which all
are invited to partake; by a means
which all are capable of using; which
nothing but voluntary blindness can
prevent our comprehending, and nothing
but wilful error can hinder us
from embracing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Muses are coy, and will only
be wooed and won by some highly-favoured
suitors. The Sciences are
lofty, and will not stoop to the reach
of ordinary capacities. But "Wisdom
(by which the royal preacher
means piety) is a loving spirit: she
is easily seen of them that love her,
and found of all such as seek her."
Nay, she is so accessible and condescending,
"that she preventeth them<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_162" id="sPage_162">[p 162]</a></span>
that desire her, making herself first
known unto them."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> are told by the same animated
writer, "that Wisdom is the breath
of the power of God." How infinitely
superior, in grandeur and sublimity,
is this description to the origin
of the <i>wisdom</i> of the heathens, as described
by their poets and mythologists!
In the exalted strains of the Hebrew
poetry we read, that "Wisdom is the
brightness of the everlasting light,
the unspotted mirror of the power
of God, and the image of his goodness."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> philosophical author of <i>The
Defence of Learning</i> observes, that
knowledge has something of venom
and malignity in it, when taken without
its proper corrective, and what<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_163" id="sPage_163">[p 163]</a></span>
that is, the inspired Saint Paul teaches
us, by placing it as the immediate antidote:
<i>Knowledge puffeth up, but charity
edifieth.</i> Perhaps, it is the vanity
of human wisdom, unchastised by this
correcting principle, which has made
so many infidels. It may proceed from
the arrogance of a self-sufficient pride,
that some philosophers disdain to acknowledge
their belief in a being, who
has judged proper to conceal from
them the infinite wisdom of his counsels;
who, (to borrow the lofty language
of the man of Uz) refused to
consult them when he laid the foundations
of the earth, when he shut up
the sea with doors, and made the
clouds the garment thereof.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A man</span> must be an infidel either
from pride, prejudice, or bad education:
he cannot be one unawares or<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_164" id="sPage_164">[p 164]</a></span>
by surprise; for infidelity is not occasioned
by sudden impulse or violent
temptation. He may be hurried by
some vehement desire into an immoral
action, at which he will blush in his
cooler moments, and which he will
lament as the sad effect of a spirit unsubdued
by religion; but infidelity is
a calm, considerate act, which cannot
plead the weakness of the heart, or
the seduction of the senses. Even
good men frequently fail in their duty
through the infirmities of nature, and
the allurements of the world; but the
infidel errs on a plan, on a settled and
deliberate principle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> though the minds of men are
sometimes fatally infected with this
disease, either through unhappy prepossession,
or some of the other causes
above mentioned; yet I am unwilling<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_165" id="sPage_165">[p 165]</a></span>
to believe, that there is in nature so
monstrously incongruous a being, as
a <i>female infidel</i>. The least reflexion on
the temper, the character, and the
education of women, makes the mind
revolt with horror from an idea so improbable,
and so unnatural.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">May</span> I be allowed to observe, that,
in general, the minds of girls seem
more aptly prepared in their early
youth for the reception of serious
impressions than those of the other sex,
and that their less exposed situations
in more advanced life qualify them
better for the preservation of them?
The daughters (of good parents I
mean) are often more carefully instructed
in their religious duties, than
the sons, and this from a variety of
causes. They are not so soon sent
from under the paternal eye into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_166" id="sPage_166">[p 166]</a></span>
bustle of the world, and so early exposed
to the contagion of bad example:
their hearts are naturally more
flexible, soft, and liable to any kind
of impression the forming hand may
stamp on them; and, lastly, as they
do not receive the same classical education
with boys, their feeble minds
are not obliged at once to receive and
separate the precepts of christianity,
and the documents of pagan philosophy.
The necessity of doing this perhaps
somewhat weakens the serious
impressions of young men, at least till
the understanding is formed, and confuses
their ideas of piety, by mixing
them with so much heterogeneous
matter. They only casually read, or
hear read, the scriptures of truth,
while they are obliged to learn by
heart, construe and repeat the poetical
fables of the less than human gods<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_167" id="sPage_167">[p 167]</a></span>
of the ancients. And as the excellent author
of <i>The Internal Evidence of the Christian
Religion</i> observes, "Nothing has
so much contributed to corrupt the
true spirit of the christian institution,
as that partiality which we contract,
in our earliest education, for the
manners of pagan antiquity."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Girls</span>, therefore, who do <i>not</i> contract
this early partiality, ought to
have a clearer notion of their religious
duties: they are not obliged, at an
age when the judgment is so weak,
to distinguish between the doctrines
of Zeno, of Epicurus, and of Christ;
and to embarrass their minds with the
various morals which were taught in
the <i>Porch</i>, in the <i>Academy</i>, and on the
<i>Mount</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_168" id="sPage_168">[p 168]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is presumed, that these remarks
cannot possibly be so misunderstood,
as to be construed into the least disrespect
to literature, or a want of the
highest reverence for a learned education,
the basis of all elegant knowledge:
they are only intended, with
all proper deference, to point out to
young women, that however inferior
their advantages of acquiring a knowledge
of the belles-lettres are to those
of the other sex; yet it depends on
themselves not to be surpassed in this
most important of all studies, for
which their abilities are equal, and
their opportunities, perhaps, greater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the mere exemption from infidelity
is so small a part of the religious
character, that I hope no one
will attempt to claim any merit from
this negative sort of goodness, or va<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_169" id="sPage_169">[p 169]</a></span>lue
herself merely for not being the
very worst thing she possibly can be.
Let no mistaken girl fancy she gives
a proof of her wit by her want of piety,
or that a contempt of things serious
and sacred will exalt her understanding,
or raise her character even in the
opinion of the most avowed male infidels.
For one may venture to affirm,
that with all their profligate ideas,
both of women and of religion, neither
Bolingbroke, Wharton, Buckingham,
nor even <i>Lord Chesterfield himself</i>, would
have esteemed a woman the more for
her being irreligious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> whatever ridicule a polite
freethinker may affect to treat religion
himself, he will think it necessary his
wife should entertain different notions
of it. He may pretend to despise it
as a matter of opinion, depending on<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_170" id="sPage_170">[p 170]</a></span>
creeds and systems; but, if he is a
man of sense, he will know the value
of it, as a governing principle, which
is to influence her conduct and direct
her actions. If he sees her unaffectedly
sincere in the practice of her religious
duties, it will be a secret pledge
to him, that she will be equally exact
in fulfilling the conjugal; for he can
have no reasonable dependance on her
attachment to <i>him</i>, if he has no opinion
of her fidelity to <span class="smcap">God</span>; for she
who neglects first duties, gives but an
indifferent proof of her disposition to
fill up inferior ones; and how can a
man of any understanding (whatever
his own religious professions may be)
trust that woman with the care of his
family, and the education of his children,
who wants herself the best incentive
to a virtuous life, the belief
that she is an accountable creature,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_171" id="sPage_171">[p 171]</a></span>
and the reflection that she has an immortal
soul?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cicero</span> spoke it as the highest commendation
of Cato's character, that
he embraced philosophy, not for the
sake of <i>disputing</i> like a philosopher,
but of <i>living</i> like one. The chief purpose
of christian knowledge is to promote
the great end of a christian life.
Every rational woman should, no
doubt, be able to give a reason of
the hope that is in her; but this knowledge
is best acquired, and the duties
consequent on it best performed, by
reading books of plain piety and practical
devotion, and not by entering
into the endless feuds, and engaging
in the unprofitable contentions of partial
controversialists. Nothing is more
unamiable than the narrow spirit of
party zeal, nor more disgusting than<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_172" id="sPage_172">[p 172]</a></span>
to hear a woman deal out judgments,
and denounce vengeance against any
one, who happens to differ from her
in some opinion, perhaps of no real
importance, and which, it is probable,
she may be just as wrong in rejecting,
as the object of her censure is
in embracing. A furious and unmerciful
female bigot wanders as far beyond
the limits prescribed to her sex,
as a Thalestris or a Joan d'Arc. Violent
debate has made as few converts
as the sword, and both these instruments
are particularly unbecoming
when wielded by a female hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, though no one will be frightened
out of their opinions, yet they
may be persuaded out of them: they
may be touched by the affecting earnestness
of serious conversation, and
allured by the attractive beauty of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_173" id="sPage_173">[p 173]</a></span>
consistently serious life. And while
a young woman ought to dread the
name of a wrangling polemic, it is her
duty to aspire after the honourable
character of a sincere Christian. But
this dignified character she can by no
means deserve, if she is ever afraid to
avow her principles, or ashamed to
defend them. A profligate, who makes
it a point to ridicule every thing which
comes under the appearance of formal
instruction, will be disconcerted at the
spirited yet modest rebuke of a pious
young woman. But there is as much
efficacy in the manner of reproving
prophaneness, as in the words. If she
corrects it with moroseness, she defeats
the effect of her remedy, by her unskilful
manner of administring it. If,
on the other hand, she affects to defend
the insulted cause of God, in a
faint tone of voice, and studied ambi<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_174" id="sPage_174">[p 174]</a></span>guity
of phrase, or with an air of levity,
and a certain expression of pleasure
in her eyes, which proves she is
secretly delighted with what she pretends
to censure, she injures religion
much more than he did who publickly
prophaned it; for she plainly indicates,
either that she does not believe, or
respect what she professes. The other
attacked it as an open foe; she betrays
it as a false friend. No one pays any
regard to the opinion of an avowed
enemy; but the desertion or treachery
of a professed friend, is dangerous indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a strange notion which prevails
in the world, that religion only belongs
to the old and the melancholy,
and that it is not worth while to pay
the least attention to it, while we are
capable of attending to any thing else.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_175" id="sPage_175">[p 175]</a></span>
They allow it to be proper enough
for the clergy, whose business it
is, and for the aged, who have not
spirits for any business at all. But till
they can prove, that none except the
clergy and the aged <i>die</i>, it must be
confessed, that this is most wretched
reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Great</span> injury is done to the interests
of religion, by placing it in a
gloomy and unamiable light. It is
sometimes spoken of, as if it would
actually make a handsome woman ugly,

any thing be more absurd than to represent
the beauty of holiness as the
source of deformity?</p>

pleasure, as not to intend, at some
future time, to set about a religious
life in good earnest. But then they
consider it as a kind of <i>dernier ressort</i>,
and think it prudent to defer flying to
this disagreeable refuge, till they have
no relish left for any thing else. Do
they forget, that to perform this great
business well requires all the strength
of their youth, and all the vigour of
their unimpaired capacities? To confirm
this assertion, they may observe
how much the slightest indisposition,
even in the most active season of
life, disorders every faculty, and disqualifies
them for attending to the
most ordinary affairs: and then let
them reflect how little able they will

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> <i>sense</i> is as different from
<i>genius</i> as perception is from invention;
yet, though distinct qualities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_179" id="sPage_179">[p 179]</a></span>
they frequently subsist together. It
is altogether opposite to <i>wit</i>, but by
no means inconsistent with it. It is
not science, for there is such a thing
as unlettered good sense; yet, though
it is neither wit, learning, nor genius,
it is a substitute for each, where they
do not exist, and the perfection of all
where they do.</p>

<p>Good sense is so far from deserving
the appellation of <i>common sense</i>, by
which it is frequently called, that it is
perhaps one of the rarest qualities of
the human mind. If, indeed, this
name is given it in respect to its peculiar
suitableness to the purposes of
common life, there is great propriety<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_180" id="sPage_180">[p 180]</a></span>
in it. Good sense appears to differ
from taste in this, that taste is an instantaneous
decision of the mind, a
sudden relish of what is beautiful, or
disgust at what is defective, in an object,
without waiting for the slower
confirmation of the judgment. Good
sense is perhaps that confirmation,
which establishes a suddenly conceived
idea, or feeling, by the powers of
comparing and reflecting. They differ
also in this, that taste seems to have
a more immediate reference to arts,
to literature, and to almost every object
of the senses; while good sense
rises to moral excellence, and exerts
its influence on life and manners. Taste
is fitted to the perception and enjoyment
of whatever is beautiful in art
or nature: Good sense, to the improvement
of the conduct, and the regulation
of the heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_181" id="sPage_181">[p 181]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> the term good sense, is used indiscriminately
to express either a finished
taste for letters, or an invariable
prudence in the affairs of life. It is
sometimes applied to the most moderate
abilities, in which case, the expression
is certainly too strong; and at
others to the most shining, when it is
as much too weak and inadequate. A
sensible man is the usual, but unappropriated
phrase, for every degree in the
scale of understanding, from the sober
mortal, who obtains it by his decent
demeanor and solid dullness, to him
whose talents qualify him to rank with
a Bacon, a Harris, or a Johnson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genius</span> is the power of invention
and imitation. It is an incommunicable
faculty: no art or skill of the
possessor can bestow the smallest portion
of it on another: no pains or la<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_182" id="sPage_182">[p 182]</a></span>bour
can reach the summit of perfection,
where the seeds of it are wanting
in the mind; yet it is capable of
infinite improvement where it actually
exists, and is attended with the highest
capacity of communicating instruction,
as well as delight to others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the peculiar property of genius
to strike out great or beautiful things:
it is the felicity of good sense not to do
absurd ones. Genius breaks out in
splendid sentiments and elevated ideas;
good sense confines its more circumscribed,
but perhaps more useful walk,
within the limits of prudence and propriety.</p>

<span class="i0">A local habitation and a name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is perhaps the finest picture of
human genius that ever was drawn by
a human pencil. It presents a living
image of a creative imagination, or a
power of inventing things which have
no actual existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> superficial judges, who, it
must be confessed, make up the greater
part of the mass of mankind, talents
are only liked or understood to a certain
degree. Lofty ideas are above
the reach of ordinary apprehensions:
the vulgar allow those who possess them
to be in a somewhat higher state of
mind than themselves; but of the vast
gulf which separates them, they have
not the least conception. They acknowledge
a superiority, but of its
extent they neither know the value,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_184" id="sPage_184">[p 184]</a></span>
nor can conceive the reality. It is
true, the mind, as well as the eye,
can take in objects larger than itself;
but this is only true of great minds:
for a man of low capacity, who considers
a consummate genius, resembles
one, who seeing a column for the first
time, and standing at too great a distance
to take in the whole of it, concludes
it to be flat. Or, like one
unacquainted with the first principles
of philosophy, who, finding the sensible
horizon appear a plain surface,
can form no idea of the spherical form
of the whole, which he does not see,
and laughs at the account of antipodes,
which he cannot comprehend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> is excellent is also rare;
what is useful is more common. How
many thousands are born qualified for
the coarse employments of life, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_185" id="sPage_185">[p 185]</a></span>
one who is capable of excelling in the
fine arts! yet so it ought to be, because
our natural wants are more numerous,
and more importunate, than
the intellectual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whenever</span> it happens that a man
of distinguished talents has been drawn
by mistake, or precipitated by passion,
into any dangerous indiscretion; it is
common for those whose coldness of
temper has supplied the place, and
usurped the name of prudence, to
boast of their own steadier virtue, and
triumph in their own superior caution;
only because they have never been assailed
by a temptation strong enough
to surprise them into error. And with
what a visible appropriation of the character
to themselves, do they constantly
conclude, with a cordial compliment
to <i>common sense</i>! They point out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_186" id="sPage_186">[p 186]</a></span>
beauty and usefulness of this quality
so forcibly and explicitly, that you
cannot possibly mistake whose picture
they are drawing with so flattering a
pencil. The unhappy man whose conduct
has been so feelingly arraigned,
perhaps acted from good, though mistaken
motives; at least, from motives
of which his censurer has not capacity
to judge: but the event was unfavourable,
nay the action might be really
wrong, and the vulgar maliciously take
the opportunity of this single indiscretion,
to lift themselves nearer on a
level with a character, which, except
in this instance, has always thrown
them at the most disgraceful and mortifying
distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> elegant Biographer of Collins,
in his affecting apology for that unfortunate
genius, remarks, "That the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_187" id="sPage_187">[p 187]</a></span>
gifts of imagination bring the heaviest
task on the vigilance of reason; and
to bear those faculties with unerring
rectitude, or invariable propriety,
requires a degree of firmness, and of
cool attention, which does not always
attend the higher gifts of the
mind; yet difficult as Nature herself
seems to have rendered the task of
regularity to genius, it is the supreme
consolation of dullness, and
of folly to point with gothic triumph
to those excesses which are the
overflowing of faculties they never
enjoyed."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> the greater part of the world
mean by common sense, will be generally
found, on a closer enquiry, to be
art, fraud, or selfishness! That sort of
saving prudence which makes men extremely
attentive to their own safety,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_188" id="sPage_188">[p 188]</a></span>
or profit; diligent in the pursuit of
their own pleasures or interests; and
perfectly at their ease as to what becomes
of the rest of mankind. Furies,
where their own property is concerned,
philosophers when nothing but the
good of others is at stake, and perfectly
resigned under all calamities but
their own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we see so many accomplished
wits of the present age, as remarkable
for the decorum of their lives, as for
the brilliancy of their writings, we may
believe, that, next to principle, it is
owing to their <i>good sense</i>, which regulates
and chastises their imaginations.
The vast conceptions which enable a
true genius to ascend the sublimest
heights, may be so connected with the
stronger passions, as to give it a natural
tendency to fly off from the strait<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_189" id="sPage_189">[p 189]</a></span>
line of regularity; till good sense, acting
on the fancy, makes it gravitate
powerfully towards that virtue which
is its proper centre.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Add</span> to this, when it is considered
with what imperfection the Divine
Wisdom has thought fit to stamp every
thing human, it will be found, that
excellence and infirmity are so inseparably
wound up in each other, that a
man derives the soreness of temper,
and irritability of nerve, which make
him uneasy to others, and unhappy in
himself, from those exquisite feelings,
and that elevated pitch of thought, by
which, as the apostle expresses it on a
more serious occasion, he is, as it were,
out of the body.</p>

<p>It is not astonishing, therefore, when
<span class="smcap">the</span> spirit is carried away by the magnificence
of its own ideas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_190" id="sPage_190">[p 190]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not touch'd but rapt, not waken'd but inspir'd,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that the frail body, which is the natural
victim of pain, disease, and death,
should not always be able to follow
the mind in its aspiring flights, but
should be as imperfect as if it belonged
only to an ordinary soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span>, might not Providence intend
to humble human pride, by presenting
to our eyes so mortifying a view of the
weakness and infirmity of even his best
work? Perhaps man, who is already
but a little lower than the angels,
might, like the revolted spirits, totally
have shaken off obedience and submission
to his Creator, had not God
wisely tempered human excellence with
a certain consciousness of its own imperfection.
But though this inevitable
alloy of weakness may frequently be<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_191" id="sPage_191">[p 191]</a></span>
found in the best characters, yet how
can that be the source of triumph and
exaltation to any, which, if properly
weighed, must be the deepest motive
of humiliation to all? A good-natured
man will be so far from rejoicing, that
he will be secretly troubled, whenever he
reads that the greatest Roman moralist
was tainted with avarice, and the
greatest British philosopher with venality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is remarked by Pope, in his Essay
on Criticism, that,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ten censure wrong for one who writes amiss.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But I apprehend it does not therefore
follow that to judge, is more difficult
than to write. If this were the case,
the critic would be superior to the
poet, whereas it appears to be directly<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_192" id="sPage_192">[p 192]</a></span>
the contrary. "The critic, (says the
great champion of Shakespeare,) but
fashions the body of a work, the poet
must add the soul, which gives force
and direction to its actions and gestures."
It should seem that the reason why so
many more judge wrong, than write
ill, is because the number of readers
is beyond all proportion greater than
the number of writers. Every man
who reads, is in some measure a critic,
and, with very common abilities, may
point out real faults and material errors
in a very well written book; but
it by no means follows that he is able
to write any thing comparable to the
work which he is capable of censuring.
And unless the numbers of those who
write, and of those who judge, were
more equal, the calculation seems not
to be quite fair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_193" id="sPage_193">[p 193]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A capacity</span> for relishing works of
genius is the indubitable sign of a good
taste. But if a proper disposition and
ability to enjoy the compositions of
others, entitle a man to the claim of
reputation, it is still a far inferior degree
of merit to his who can invent and
produce those compositions, the bare
disquisition of which gives the critic
no small share of fame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> president of the royal academy
in his admirable <i>Discourse</i> on <i>imitation</i>,
has set the folly of depending on unassisted
genius, in the clearest light; and
has shewn the necessity of adding the
knowledge of others, to our own native
powers, in his usual striking and masterly
manner. "The mind, says he, is a
barren soil, is a soil soon exhausted,
and will produce no crop, or only
one, unless it be continually fertiliz<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_194" id="sPage_194">[p 194]</a></span>ed,
and enriched with foreign matter."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> it has been objected that study
is a great enemy to originality; but
even if this were true, it would perhaps
be as well that an author should
give us the ideas of still better writers,
mixed and assimilated with the matter
in his own mind, as those crude and
undigested thoughts which he values
under the notion that they are original.
The sweetest honey neither tastes of the
rose, the honeysuckle, nor the carnation,
yet it is compounded of the very
essence of them all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> in the other fine arts this accumulation
of knowledge is necessary,
it is indispensably so in poetry. It is a
fatal rashness for any one to trust too
much to their own stock of ideas.<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_195" id="sPage_195">[p 195]</a></span>
He must invigorate them by exercise,
polish them by conversation, and increase
them by every species of elegant
and virtuous knowledge, and the mind
will not fail to reproduce with interest
those seeds, which are sown in it by
study and observation. Above all,
let every one guard against the dangerous
opinion that he knows enough:
an opinion that will weaken the energy
and reduce the powers of the mind,
which, though once perhaps vigorous
and effectual, will be sunk to a state
of literary imbecility, by cherishing
vain and presumptuous ideas of its
own independence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> instance, it may not be necessary
that a poet should be deeply skilled in
the Linn&aelig;an system; but it must be
allowed that a general acquaintance
with plants and flowers will furnish<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_196" id="sPage_196">[p 196]</a></span>
him with a delightful and profitable species
of instruction. He is not obliged to
trace Nature in all her nice and varied
operations, with the minute accuracy
of a Boyle, or the laborious investigation
of a Newton; but his <i>good sense</i>
will point out to him that no inconsiderable
portion of philosophical knowledge
is requisite to the completion of
his literary character. The sciences
are more independent, and require
little or no assistance from the graces
of poetry; but poetry, if she would
charm and instruct, must not be so
haughty; she must be contented to
borrow of the sciences, many of her
choicest allusions, and many of her
most graceful embellishments; and does
it not magnify the character of true
poesy, that she includes within herself
all the scattered graces of every separate
art?<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_197" id="sPage_197">[p 197]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> rules of the great masters in
criticism may not be so necessary to
the forming a good taste, as the examination
of those original mines
from whence they drew their treasures
of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three celebrated Essays on the
Art of Poetry do not teach so much
by their laws as by their examples;
the dead letter of their rules is less instructive
than the living spirit of their
verse. Yet these rules are to a young
poet, what the study of logarithms is
to a young mathematician; they do
not so much contribute to form his
judgment, as afford him the satisfaction
of convincing him that he is right.
They do not preclude the difficulty of
the operation; but at the conclusion of
it, furnish him with a fuller demonstration
that he has proceeded on pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_198" id="sPage_198">[p 198]</a></span>per
principles. When he has well
studied the masters in whose schools
the first critics formed themselves, and
fancies he has caught a spark of their
divine Flame, it may be a good method
to try his own compositions by
the test of the critic rules, so far indeed
as the mechanism of poetry goes.
If the examination be fair and candid,
this trial, like the touch of Ithuriel's
spear, will detect every latent error, and
bring to light every favourite failing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Good</span> taste always suits the measure
of its admiration to the merit of the
composition it examines. It accommodates
its praises, or its censure, to
the excellence of a work, and appropriates
it to the nature of it. General
applause, or indiscriminate abuse, is
the sign of a vulgar understanding.
There are certain blemishes which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_199" id="sPage_199">[p 199]</a></span>
judicious and good-natured reader will
candidly overlook. But the false sublime,
the tumour which is intended
for greatness, the distorted figure, the
puerile conceit, and the incongruous
metaphor, these are defects for which
scarcely any other kind of merit can
atone. And yet there may be more
hope of a writer (especially if he be a
a young one), who is now and then
guilty of some of these faults, than of
one who avoids them all, not through
judgment, but feebleness, and who,
instead of deviating into error is continually
falling short of excellence.
The meer absence of error implies that
moderate and inferior degree of merit
with which a cold heart and a phlegmatic
taste will be better satisfied than
with the magnificent irregularities of
exalted spirits. It stretches some minds
to an uneasy extension to be obliged<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_200" id="sPage_200">[p 200]</a></span>
to attend to compositions superlatively
excellent; and it contracts liberal souls
to a painful narrowness to descend to
books of inferior merit. A work of
capital genius, to a man of an ordinary
mind, is the bed of Procrustes to one
of a short stature, the man is too little
to fill up the space assigned him, and
undergoes the torture in attempting
it: and a moderate, or low production
to a man of bright talents, is the punishment
inflicted by Mezentius; the
living spirit has too much animation to
endure patiently to be in contact with
a dead body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taste</span> sesms to be a sentiment of
the soul which gives the bias to opinion,
for we feel before we reflect. Without
this sentiment, all knowledge, learning
and opinion, would be cold, inert
materials, whereas they become active<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_201" id="sPage_201">[p 201]</a></span>
principles when stirred, kindled, and
inflamed by this animating quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is another feeling which is
called Enthusiasm. The enthusiasm
of sensible hearts is so strong, that it
not only yields to the impulse with
which striking objects act on it, but
such hearts help on the effect by their
own sensibility. In a scene where
Shakespeare and Garrick give perfection
to each other, the feeling heart
does not merely accede to the delirium
they occasion: it does more, it is enamoured
of it, it solicits the delusion,
it sues to be deceived, and grudgingly
cherishes the sacred treasure of its feelings.
The poet and performer concur
in carrying us</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Beyond this visible diurnal sphere,<br /></span>

<p>they bear us aloft in their airy
course with unresisted rapidity, if
they meet not with any obstruction<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_202" id="sPage_202">[p 202]</a></span>
from the coldness of our own feelings.
Perhaps, only a few fine spirits can
enter into the detail of their writing
and acting; but the multitude do not
enjoy less acutely, because they are
not able philosophically to analyse the
sources of their joy or sorrow. If the
others have the advantage of judging,
these have at least the privilege of
feeling: and it is not from complaisance
to a few leading judges, that they
burst into peals of laughter, or melt
into delightful agony; their hearts decide,
and that is a decision from which
there lies no appeal. It must however
be confessed, that the nicer separations
of character, and the lighter
and almost imperceptible shades which
sometimes distinguish them, will not
be intimately relished, unless there be
a consonancy of taste as well as feeling
in the spectator; though where the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_203" id="sPage_203">[p 203]</a></span>
passions are principally concerned, the
profane vulgar come in for a larger
portion of the universal delight, than
critics and connoisseurs are willing to
allow them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> enthusiasm, though the natural
concomitant of genius, is no more
genius itself, than drunkenness is cheerfulness;
and that enthusiasm which
discovers itself on occasions not worthy
to excite it, is the mark of a wretched
judgment and a false taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span> produces innumerable objects:
to imitate them, is the province
of Genius; to direct those imitations,
is the property of Judgment; to decide
on their effects, is the business of Taste.
For Taste, who sits as supreme judge
on the productions of Genius, is not
satisfied when she merely imitates Na<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_204" id="sPage_204">[p 204]</a></span>ture:
she must also, says an ingenious
French writer, imitate <i>beautiful</i>
Nature. It requires no less judgment
to reject than to choose, and Genius
might imitate what is vulgar, under
pretence that it was natural, if Taste
did not carefully point out those objects
which are most proper for imitation.
It also requires a very nice discernment
to distinguish verisimilitude
from truth; for there is a truth in
Taste nearly as conclusive as demonstration
in mathematics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Genius</span>, when in the full impetuosity
of its career, often touches on the
very brink of error; and is, perhaps,
never so near the verge of the precipice,
as when indulging its sublimest
flights. It is in those great, but dangerous
moments, that the curb of
vigilant judgment is most wanting:<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_205" id="sPage_205">[p 205]</a></span>
while safe and sober Dulness observes
one tedious and insipid round of tiresome
uniformity, and steers equally
clear of eccentricity and of beauty.
Dulness has few redundancies to retrench,
few luxuriancies to prune, and
few irregularities to smooth. These,
though errors, are the errors of Genius,
for there is rarely redundancy
without plenitude, or irregularity without
greatness. The excesses of Genius
may easily be retrenched, but the deficiencies
of Dulness can never be supplied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who copy from others will
doubtless be less excellent than those
who copy from Nature. To imitate
imitators, is the way to depart too far
from the great original herself. The
latter copies of an engraving retain
fainter and fainter traces of the sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_206" id="sPage_206">[p 206]</a></span>ject,
to which the earlier impressions
bore so strong a resemblance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> seems very extraordinary, that it
should be the most difficult thing in
the world to be natural, and that it
should be harder to hit off the manners
of real life, and to delineate such characters
as we converse with every day,
than to imagine such as do not exist.
But caricature is much easier than an
exact outline, and the colouring of
fancy less difficult than that of truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">People</span> do not always know what taste
they have, till it is awakened by some
corresponding object; nay, genius itself
is a fire, which in many minds
would never blaze, if not kindled by
some external cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nature</span>, that munificent mother,
when she bestows the power of judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_207" id="sPage_207">[p 207]</a></span>ing,
accompanies it with the capacity
of enjoying. The judgment, which
is clear sighted, points out such objects
as are calculated to inspire love, and
the heart instantaneously attaches itself
to whatever is lovely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> regard to literary reputation, a
great deal depends on the state of
learning in the particular age or nation,
in which an author lives. In a
dark and ignorant period, moderate
knowledge will entitle its possessor to
a considerable share of fame; whereas,
to be distinguished in a polite and lettered
age, requires striking parts and
deep erudition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> a nation begins to emerge
from a state of mental darkness, and to
strike out the first rudiments of improvement,
it chalks out a few strong<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_208" id="sPage_208">[p 208]</a></span>
but incorrect sketches, gives the rude
out-lines of general art, and leaves the
filling up to the leisure of happier
days, and the refinement of more enlightened
times. Their drawing is a
rude <i>Sbozzo</i>, and their poetry wild
minstrelsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perfection</span> of taste is a point which
a nation no sooner reaches, than it
overshoots; and it is more difficult to
return to it, after having passed it,
than it was to attain when they fell
short of it. Where the arts begin to
languish after having flourished, they
seldom indeed fall back to their original
barbarism, but a certain feebleness
of exertion takes place, and it is more
difficult to recover them from this
dying languor to their proper strength,
than it was to polish them from their
former rudeness; for it is a less for<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_209" id="sPage_209">[p 209]</a></span>midable
undertaking to refine barbarity,
than to stop decay: the first may
be laboured into elegance, but the
latter will rarely be strengthened into
vigour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Taste</span> exerts itself at first but feebly
and imperfectly: it is repressed and kept
back by a crowd of the most discouraging
prejudices: like an infant
prince, who, though born to reign,
yet holds an idle sceptre, which he has
not power to use, but is obliged to see
with the eyes, and hear through the
ears of other men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> of correct taste will hardly
ever go out of his way, even in
search of embellishment: he will study
to attain the best end by the most natural
means; for he knows that what
is not natural cannot be beautiful, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_210" id="sPage_210">[p 210]</a></span>
that nothing can be beautiful out of
its own place; for an improper situation
will convert the most striking
beauty into a glaring defect. When
by a well-connected chain of ideas,
or a judicious succession of events, the
reader is snatched to "Thebes or
Athens," what can be more impertinent
than for the poet to obstruct the
operation of the passion he has just
been kindling, by introducing a conceit
which contradicts his purpose,
and interrupts his business? Indeed,
we cannot be transported, even in
idea, to those places, if the poet does
not manage so adroitly as not to make
us sensible of the journey: the instant
we feel we are travelling, the writer's
art fails, and the delirium is at an end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Proserpine</span>, says Ovid, would have
been restored to her mother Ceres, had<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_211" id="sPage_211">[p 211]</a></span>
not Ascalaphus seen her stop to gather
a golden apple, when the terms of her
restoration were, that she should taste
nothing. A story pregnant with instruction
for lively writers, who by
neglecting the main business, and going
out of the way for false gratifications,
lose sight of the end they should
principally keep in view. It was this
false taste that introduced the numberless
<i>concetti</i>, which disgrace the brightest
of the Italian poets; and this is the
reason, why the reader only feels short
and interrupted snatches of delight in
perusing the brilliant but unequal
compositions of Ariosto, instead of
that unbroken and undiminished pleasure,
which he constantly receives from
Virgil, from Milton, and generally
from Tasso. The first-mentioned Italian
is the Atalanta, who will interrupt
the most eager career, to pick up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_212" id="sPage_212">[p 212]</a></span>
glittering mischief, while the Mantuan
and the British bards, like Hippomenes,
press on warm in the pursuit,
and unseduced by temptation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A writer</span> of real taste will take
great pains in the perfection of his style,
to make the reader believe that he took
none at all. The writing which appears
to be most easy, will be generally
found to be least imitable. The
most elegant verses are the most easily
retained, they fasten themselves on the
memory, without its making any effort
to preserve them, and we are apt to imagine,
that what is remembered with
ease, was written without difficulty.</p>

<p>To conclude; Genius is a rare and
precious gem, of which few know
the worth; it is fitter for the cabinet
of the connoisseur, than for the com<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_213" id="sPage_213">[p 213]</a></span>merce
of mankind. Good sense is a
bank-bill, convenient for change, negotiable
at all times, and current in
all places. It knows the value of
small things, and considers that an
aggregate of them makes up the sum
of human affairs. It elevates common
concerns into matters of importance,
by performing them in the best manner,
and at the most suitable season.
Good sense carries with it the idea of
equality, while Genius is always suspected
of a design to impose the burden
of superiority; and respect is paid to
it with that reluctance which always
attends other imposts, the lower orders
of mankind generally repining
most at demands, by which they are
least liable to be affected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> it is the character of Genius to
penetrate with a lynx's beam into<span class='pagenum'><a name="sPage_214" id="sPage_214">[p 214]</a></span>
unfathomable abysses and uncreated
worlds, and to see what is <i>not</i>, so it
is the property of good sense to distinguish
perfectly, and judge accurately
what really <i>is</i>. Good sense has not so
piercing an eye, but it has as clear a
sight: it does not penetrate so deeply,
but as far as it <i>does</i> see, it discerns
distinctly. Good sense is a judicious
mechanic, who can produce beauty
and convenience out of suitable means;
but Genius (I speak with reverence of
the immeasurable distance) bears some
remote resemblance to the divine architect,
who produced perfection of
beauty without any visible materials,
<i>who spake, and it was created</i>; who
said, <i>Let it be, and it was</i>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
